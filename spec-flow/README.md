# spec-flow — the agent host

The delegable half of the specification flow, built on the
[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/)
(`Microsoft.Agents.AI` 1.21.0). The other half is the Rust `spec` binary
(`spec-core` / `spec-cli`), and the split between them is not a packaging
decision — it is the accountability boundary of the flow itself.

## The split

| Verb | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `import` | **.NET, here** | Roslyn scan → `.spec/inventory.json`; re-derivable, so delegating it is straightforwardly good |
| `implement` | **.NET, here** | builds a slice; produces a **pending** record |
| `candidates`, `map`, `check` | Rust | read-only over the store; the gate is a closed class set |
| **`accept`**, **`reject`**, **`close`**, **`policy set`** | **Rust only** | each names a principal, and a machine cannot be one |

## MCP

Two servers, one subset. Both withhold every verb that names a principal.

```bash
specflow mcp --root . --spec target/debug/spec     # .NET — the complete surface
spec-mcp .                                          # Rust — no .NET required
```

`specflow mcp` is the complete one because it adds **`spec_import`** natively.
Its five read tools are *proxied* to the `spec` binary rather than
reimplemented — one implementation of what the store means, so an MCP client
and a CI run cannot be told different things about the same repo. Tools carry
MCP annotations: `ReadOnly` on the reads, `Idempotent` on import.

Its boundary is the strong one. The assembly contains no code that writes a
closure, every call out goes through `SpecCli`, and `ForbiddenVerbs` throws on
a withheld verb. The Rust server's is weaker and says so: a registry boundary,
not a linkage one.

**The agent is an MCP client too.** `GovernedTools.ConnectAsync` connects the
slice-building `AIAgent` to `spec-mcp` and gives it those tools and nothing
else. An agent holding only governed surfaces cannot escape through
un-governed tooling; what it can still do is mismanage its own context, and
that is an honest limit rather than a gap. The client re-filters
`Server.Withheld` instead of trusting the server — a surface that trusts what
it is handed inherits the other side's next mistake.

A model may do everything up to the decision. It may not commit it.

## `import`

```bash
dotnet run --project spec-flow/src/SpecFlow.Cli -- import --root . --source ../their-repo
```

Syntax-first over parsed trees, with whatever references happen to resolve. It
does not need a restored, buildable project: an importer that only works on a
green build is one that does not run on the codebases most worth importing.

Recognised: controller routes (`[HttpGet]`/`[HttpPost]`/`[Route]`), minimal-api
maps, `IHostedService`/`BackgroundService`, `IConsumer`/`IRequestHandler` and
friends, `static Main`. A convention it misses shows up as a *missing* entry
point, never a wrong one — an under-reporting importer loses candidates, an
over-reporting one manufactures acts nobody has.

**It never guesses an act name.** Candidates carry observed transport fields
and the unfilled slots `name` and `settles`. A route's name accepted as an
act's name is how every act becomes an endpoint with a better label, which is
the whole reason the candidate vocabulary is graded measurement-only.

The inventory is a **projection**: rebuilt wholesale each run, carrying no
verdict and no ratification, and ordered so an unchanged codebase scans
byte-identically. Without that, every re-run would read as drift.

## Why the process boundary is the point

§14.2 of the PRD asks for the restriction to be *structural, not instructed* —
"a rule held in prose is not enforced, and an MCP surface told not to call a
verb is prose." A process boundary is the cheapest structural version of that:
the agent host does not link the code that writes a closure, so there is no
call it could make.

Three things hold it in place, each independently checkable:

1. `SpecCli.ForbiddenVerbs` throws when a `close` is assembled, wherever in the
   argument list it appears.
2. `BoundaryTests.No_public_member_of_the_flow_assembly_closes_a_record`
   reflects over the exported surface and fails if one ever appears.
3. The workflow graph has no edge to a closure — `HandOffExecutor` renders a
   command string and stops.

On the Rust side the same boundary is `S002`, which delegates to the ledger's
`Identity::model_or_bot_reason` — the identical test `L006` applies to an
acceptor. One identity law, two gates.

## Why a workflow rather than an agent loop

The g-track PRD (§7.8) ruled against ceding the loop to an agent runtime
because "the inner planner's context management and prompting are the
runtime's own — an arrangement whose absorbable forms and retrieval habits we
do not author."

MAF's **Workflows** layer does not have that problem. The graph is authored
here: executors, edges, and the order they run in are ours. The framework
supplies the superstep scheduler (deterministic traversal, type-checked edges
at `Build()`, checkpoints at superstep boundaries) and stays out of the
ordering. That is the part worth switching for; the agent layer is incidental.

The one place a model enters is `BuildSliceExecutor`, and its strategy is
*injected* — which model, which endpoint, which instructions stay arrangement
parameters, so the model ladder remains an experiment rather than a constant.

## The graph

```
ImplementRequest
   ↓
[open-record]    → `spec implement` opens the act-time record, first, before any work
   ↓ ActRecordOpened
[build-slice]    → the delegable half; an AIAgent, or anything else you inject
   ↓ SliceBuilt
[draft-closure]  → shapes what arose into a draft
   ↓ ClosureDraft
[closure-draft-review]  ← RequestPort<ClosureDraft, DraftReview>: the human-in-the-loop port
   ↓ DraftReview
[hand-off]       → yields the `spec close …` command. Renders it; never runs it.
```

The record opens *first* on purpose: a record opened after the work is a record
a crashed run never opens, and the write-back leg exists precisely because a
write that can be skipped will be skipped.

## Running it

Put the host beside the `spec` binary and one command name covers the flow:

```bash
cargo build -p spec-cli                       # the Rust half
dotnet publish spec-flow/src/SpecFlow.Cli -c Release -o target/debug

spec import                                   # → specflow import
spec build --slice checkout-totals --act act/settle-basket
```

`spec build` always exits **3** — work completed, closure pending. Then, as
yourself:

```bash
spec close <id> --principal you@example.com --nothing-arose
spec check                                     # 0 only once every record is closed
```

`spec import` and `spec build` are the only two verbs that leave the Rust
binary. Each launches `specflow`, which is found beside `spec`, or at
`SPECFLOW_BIN`, or on PATH — and which is handed the launching binary as its
`--spec` so the chain cannot resolve a different one. **Launching is not
linking:** the host still contains no code that writes a closure, `spec build`
reaches it as `specflow implement`, and the launcher refuses to forward a verb
that names a principal. The boundary is where it was; only the front door moved.

The host also stands alone, which is what the .NET tests drive:

```bash
dotnet test spec-flow/SpecFlow.slnx           # drives the real `spec` binary
dotnet run --project spec-flow/src/SpecFlow.Cli -- implement \
  --slice checkout-totals --act act/settle-basket --root . --spec target/debug/spec
```

To wire a model, set `SPECFLOW_MODEL_ENDPOINT` (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
— Scaleway, Ollama, vLLM), plus `SPECFLOW_MODEL` and `SPECFLOW_MODEL_KEY`.

## The whole flow, end to end

```bash
cargo build -p spec-cli
scripts/checks/spec-flow-e2e.sh
```

Walks a throwaway repo through import → check (drift) → accept → reject →
implement → check (open record) → close → check (green), asserting the
refusals along the way: a machine cannot ratify, a machine cannot close,
`implement` exits 3. It runs in CI.

## Known gaps

- **Checkpointing is not wired.** MAF takes checkpoints at superstep
  boundaries, but only `CheckpointManager.CreateInMemory()` is documented for
  .NET — Python has a pluggable `CheckpointStorage`, .NET appears not to. It
  does not block this flow: the act-time record on disk *is* the durable pause,
  and it outlives the process by design. Wire checkpoints only for
  intra-run resilience on long builds, and expect to write the store.
- **Executor identity is fragile.** A checkpoint resumes only into a graph with
  matching executor identities, and ids assigned later do not repair earlier
  checkpoints. `ExecutorIds` holds logical-role constants for this reason; keep
  request and conversation ids out of them.
- **Signing says a key holder acted, not that the human did.** Custody,
  rotation and revocation are not modelled in v1, and the ledger's own
  `Acceptance.signature` is still empty at L0. See §4e of
  `docs/spec-flow-store-v1.md`.
