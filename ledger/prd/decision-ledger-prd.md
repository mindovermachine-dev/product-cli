# PRD — Decision Ledger

**Working name:** `ledger` (binary TBD — see Open Decision OD-1)
**Status:** projected. Derived, not exercised. Falsifiers stated in §13.
**Audience:** an implementer or a fresh session with no prior context. §1–3 are the minimum canon needed to work from this document cold.
**Document stack:** DAD (`way-of-working-decision-allocated-delivery.md`) is the process; the `ddd` tool (`ddd-cli-prd.md`) is the governance mechanism; this document is canonical for the decision **record substrate**. The ddd tool is a producer and consumer of ledger entries (its M8 is the integration); this PRD's own milestones (§11, prefixed L0–L5 to disambiguate from the ddd tool's M-series) run as their own track and L0 is independently useful.

## 1. Problem

Software has no depositional record.

Archaeology works because physical processes leave stratigraphy whether or not anyone intended to record anything — spoil layers, tool marks, post-holes. Software overwrites in place. Git records what changed, not what was weighed. A commit that *settled* twenty decisions is byte-identical to one that *defaulted* them.

This matters because a chosen value and an unchosen value produce identical artifacts. They diverge only when something goes wrong: one is a decision you can revisit, the other is archaeology. Every other property of a system can be recovered by inspection given enough effort. The deliberation record cannot be recovered at any effort, because there was never anything to find.

So it must be deposited deliberately or not at all.

Three prior attempts and why they failed:

| Attempt | Deposits deliberately | Fails on |
|---|---|---|
| Commit messages | yes | prose not entities; commit-granular not decision-granular; no criterion form; no coverage denominator |
| ADRs | yes | granularity (architecture only); no discharge; no coverage |
| Prompt/memory files (`CLAUDE.md`, rules) | accidentally | append-only with no supersession, no provenance, no criterion form, no tolerance scoping |

Each got the location right (in the repo, reviewed with the code) and the structure wrong.

---

## 2. Conceptual foundation

Compressed canon. Sufficient to implement against; not the full framework.

### 2.1 The principle

For a task at a declared assurance level, **specification demand is constant** — fixed by the task, never by the system or the actor. It is fully allocated across four stores:

| Store | Form | When | Decided by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `constraint` | constraint form | before the act | extra-actor (compiler, analyzer, policy) |
| `criterion` | criterion form | after the act | extra-actor (test, assertion, telemetry) |
| `judgment` | per-run | during the act | a **named** accountable actor |
| `escaped` | — | — | **nobody** |

Total never shrinks. Demand is denominated in **governing decisions**. `escaped` is the only forbidden state — but *priced* escape (exposure stated, acceptor named, review date set) is a legitimate allocation. Silent escape is not.

### 2.2 Assurance level

Sets the **granularity bound**. A decision is *governing* iff varying it moves the outcome past tolerance. Assurance level is a reading of consequence, not a dial — declaring a lower tier does not make a task cheaper, it makes the declaration false, and every downstream gate still passes because gates are relative to the declared tier.

**This is the one place in the system with no mechanical check.** See §13.

### 2.3 Ground

The read-only surface an actor inspects in order to act. A fact is one element of ground. Ground is substrate, not demand: facts are inspected, not decided.

Existing code **is** ground — but only relative to an actor that did not produce it (the closure principle: an actor's own prior output is not ground for that actor). Code is ground with respect to *behaviour* and silent with respect to *decisions*: it never records whether a site was a decision at all, what alternatives were rejected, or what tolerance it was governing at.

### 2.4 Coverage, not pass-rate

A green board over an unenumerated set means nothing. The denominator is the governing decision set. **Coverage is a claim about absence relative to a declared set** — which is precisely the operation git cannot perform, and the reason this tool cannot be git with different object types.

---

## 3. What this tool is

**A version-control system for decisions**, with git's interaction and trust model, a semantic entity store underneath, and one primitive git does not have (coverage).

### 3.1 It is

- Append-only, attributed, content-addressed record of governing decisions
- Local-first, offline-capable, branchable, mergeable
- The source for four standing instruments (§10)
- A CI gate: readiness (nothing unallocated) and completeness (everything disposed)
- Federated across repos, because seam decisions belong to no single repo

### 3.2 It is not

- A test runner or verifier — it *records* discharge, it does not perform it
- A project tracker — decisions are not tasks and have no assignee or status board
- An authoring tool — it does not propose decisions; models and humans do, through it
- A wiki or documentation system — every entry is machine-checkable or it does not belong

### 3.3 Design stance taken from git

Content-addressed immutable objects · local-first with cheap branching · explicit staging between "noticed" and "accepted" · `blame` as a first-class primitive · distributed replication.

### 3.4 Design stance explicitly rejected from git

| Git does | Ledger does instead | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Commits snapshot the whole tree | Per-entity versioning, grouped by change-set | Decisions have independent lifecycles; one act touches 4 of 200 |
| Diff by line | Semantic diff (added, reallocated, superseded, escape-converted, acceptance-expired) | Textual diff on YAML is noise |
| Three-way text merge | Decision-level conflict requiring a named acceptor | Text-merging allocations produces plausible garbage — the worst failure mode for this artifact |
| Rewritable history (rebase, squash, force-push) | Append-only with explicit revocation entries | An acceptance a rebase can destroy is not an acceptance |
| Single merge base (a commit) | Merge base **per decision** | Two branches can share no change-set ancestry and still merge cleanly on 198 of 200 decisions |

---

## 4. Data model

### 4.1 Identity

**A decision has identity independent of any repository.** This is settled: seam decisions cross repos, and the highest-consequence decisions frequently have no natural repo home.

```
dec:<namespace>/<ulid>
e.g. dec:acme.billing/01J9Z4KQ7M8XTBVR3N2P6WCDHF
```

- **ULID** (or UUIDv7): offline-generatable, lexicographically sortable by creation time, no coordination required.
- **Namespace**: an owning scope, not a repo path. Repos may reference decisions in namespaces they do not own.
- The ID is **stable forever**. Supersession creates a new decision with a `supersedes` edge; it never mutates or reuses an ID.

### 4.2 Entities

```
Decision           stable id, namespace, created-at, created-by
DecisionVersion    content-hash; statement, allocation, discharge ref,
                   tolerance-override (optional, up-only), exposure (if escaped),
                   parent version
ChangeSet          attributed, timestamped, append-only; groups N version
                   transitions; references parent change-set(s)
Acceptance         (decision-id, version-hash, actor, timestamp, scope, expires-at)
Revocation         explicit reversal of a prior Acceptance, with reason
DecisionSet        a declared scope: task/feature, tolerance floor, ground state,
                   owner, membership
DischargeRef       typed pointer: analyzer:ID | test:FQN | policy:ID |
                   whatif:assertion | otel:metric+expectation | actor:identity
Instrument         a recorded reading (§10)
```

### 4.2.1 Tolerance: floor and up-only override (OD-4, resolved)

The set's tolerance is a **floor**, not a default. A decision's **effective tier** is the set
floor unless the version carries a `tolerance-override`, which is valid **only above the floor**
— a below-floor override is a schema violation, rejected at write, not flagged at review. There
is no representable state in which a decision sits below its set's regime: silent tier-shopping
is not caught, it is *unexpressible* (the predicates-carry-no-status move, applied to
governance). Up-overrides need no guard — over-classifying upward costs the author ceremony,
which is self-punishing — and are logged, not gated.

Consequences, priced:

- The **effective tier is part of the hashed content** (via floor-at-version-creation +
  override), so acceptance binds to the tier and a tier change is a new version requiring
  re-acceptance.
- **Raising a set's floor is a set-level governed act** that re-opens acceptance on every member
  whose effective tier falls below the new floor. Stranded entries are re-accepted at the new
  floor, never grandfathered.
- The escape pressure relocates to **set design**: the residual gaming move is filing a
  consequential decision into a low-floor set and not overriding up — far more visible than a
  silent enum (set membership is *where the entry lives*, reviewable at acceptance), and
  instrumented: **override-rate per set** (§10) — a set whose entries constantly override upward
  has its floor drawn wrong, a finding about the decomposition, not the author.

### 4.3 The version hash

`DecisionVersion` content is canonicalised and hashed. **Acceptance signs the hash, never the id.** This is the property that makes acceptance mean something: it names an exact state, not "whatever DEC-004 currently says." Any edit to an accepted decision invalidates the acceptance and requires re-acceptance by a named actor.

### 4.4 Constraints enforced by the store

- Exactly one `allocation` per decision-version; redundancy across stores is permitted but one is primary
- `tolerance-override` below the set floor is rejected at write (schema, not review); effective
  tier participates in the content hash
- Raising a set floor re-opens acceptance on members stranded below it; `verify` fails on
  stranded-unreaccepted entries
- `escaped` requires `exposure`, `accepted-by`, `review-by`
- `criterion` requires a `DischargeRef` and a `discharge-stage`
- `judgment` requires a named `actor`
- `accepted-by` **must not** resolve to a model identity (§9.3)
- Expired acceptances are a verify failure, not a warning
- No mutation of any object after write; corrections are new versions, reversals are Revocations

### 4.5 Acceptance signatures — planned, not implemented (OD-3's scheduled upgrade)

Ruled 2026-08-11 (principal: Emil), scheduled as milestone **L6** and spec
**v1.5 / `format: 4`** — the migration record's original "populating
`signature` is a `format: 2`" slot was consumed by L3's `merged_from`, and
the renumbered `format: 3` slot by ddd M8's `contract:` discharge scheme
(spec v1.4), so the signing bump renumbers again; nothing else about the
plan changes. **None of this
is implemented.** The normative answer today remains OD-3's claimed identity;
this section exists so an L6 session can be prompted from it alone. It lives
under the data model because the signature is a property of the `Acceptance`
entity and its canonical payload — the sibling of §4.3's version hash — and
because the trust root is itself ledger content, not an external integration.

Five rulings:

1. **Sign the acceptance payload, not the commit.** The signature covers a
   canonical payload — decision id, version hash, actor identity, signing
   timestamp — and is stored detached, in the `signature` field L0 reserved.
   A signed commit attests that someone committed; an acceptance must attest
   that a named human bound themselves to a specific version hash. The
   payload signature survives export, replay into another substrate (the Org
   Ledger import), and entry movement; a commit signature survives none of
   those. `L009`'s blame check is unchanged and independent: blame attests
   authorship of the introducing commit, the signature attests acceptance.
2. **Formats are git's own** — `gpg.format`: `openpgp` | `ssh` | `x509`.
   SSH and X.509 are the practical paths; X.509 is the bridge to the org
   product, where Entra-issued certificates make dev-side and org-side
   identity one mechanism rather than two.
3. **Tier-gated, not universal.** A signature is required above the
   tolerance floor: T2 acceptances are signed; T1 keeps today's claimed
   identity from git config. This is the dev-side analogue of the org
   product's step-up auth, derived from the same OD-4 floor mechanism — and
   because the floor is up-only, the signature requirement cannot be shopped
   out of either.
4. **The trust root is a governed artifact.** An allowed-signers set (git's
   `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` is the precedent; X.509 uses CA trust)
   records which keys are authorised for which identity. It is itself a set
   of decisions and lives in the ledger. The bootstrap regress does not
   close: the first trust-root entry is an explicitly-named **genesis**
   entry, self-attested and conspicuous, never disguised as ordinary.
5. **Validity at signing time; revocation raises a finding.** Signature
   validity is evaluated against the recorded signing timestamp, so routine
   key rotation does not retroactively invalidate history. A key revoked
   after the fact produces a review trigger — "acceptances exist under a
   since-revoked key" — never auto-invalidation.

Two verify classes are **named now, implemented at L6**, joining the file
gate by the same spec-amendment mechanism that added `L010` (the closed
count of ten becomes twelve when the revision lands):

- **`L011`** — an acceptance whose effective tier requires a signature
  carries none, or carries one that does not verify against the trust root
  as of its signing timestamp.
- **`L012`** — acceptances exist under a since-revoked key: a review
  trigger per ruling 5, reported as a finding, never as retroactive
  invalidation of the acceptance.

Hashing is unaffected throughout: the signature is *over* the version hash,
never inside it — no digest moves and `CANONICAL_FORM` stays `v1`.

---

## 5. Storage architecture

**Files in git are the log. The graph is a materialized view.**

```
.decisions/
  sets/<set-id>.yml            declared scope, tolerance, ground, owner
  log/<changeset-ulid>.yml     append-only; the source of truth
  index/                       gitignored; rebuildable cache
```

- The log is plain text, diffable, and travels with the code through normal review. This preserves the one property git supplies and ADRs-in-Confluence lose: **the ledger is amendable only in the same reviewed unit as the code it governs.** A ledger that can drift from the artifact is prose again.
- The graph (embedded RDF store; Oxigraph assumed) is derived and disposable — `ledger reindex` rebuilds it from the log with no loss. It exists solely to answer coverage and provenance queries, which are not expressible over a file tree.
- Acceptance provenance modelled with **PROV-O**; structural validity with **SHACL**.

**Test of correctness for this split:** deleting `index/` and rebuilding must produce a byte-identical graph. If it cannot, state has leaked into the cache.

## 7. Merge semantics

Merge is per-decision. For each decision present on either side, find the common ancestor version.

| Situation | Resolution |
|---|---|
| One side changed | Fast-forward that decision |
| Both sides identical | No-op |
| Both changed, same allocation, different discharge | Conflict — surfaced |
| Both changed, different allocation | Conflict — surfaced |
| One superseded, other discharged | Conflict — surfaced |
| One accepted, other edited | Conflict; acceptance invalidated by hash |
| Added on one side only | Merge in, unaccepted |

**A conflict is a question for a named acceptor, never an automatic resolution.** No `-X ours`. No auto-merge strategy. The tool presents both allocations, the ancestor, and requires an `accept` to resolve. This is the single most important behavioural constraint in the design: silently merging two different allocations of the same decision manufactures escape while displaying success.

Inherited from the L1+L2 report (PR #32, "Open edges L3 inherits"):

- **Merge reconciles divergent version chains, not files.** L1's stale-parent
  refusal (`revise` against a parent that is no longer latest refuses, naming
  L3) marks exactly where a per-decision merge base becomes necessary: two
  writers revising from one parent each hold a change-set the other's store
  refuses. What merge resolves is those chains — the log files themselves are
  append-only and never in conflict.
- **"Latest" must derive from the parent DAG, not ULID order.** The shipped L1
  computes latest as ULID order of change-sets — the single-writer leak,
  named: ULIDs order by one clock, and two writers' clocks prove nothing
  about parenthood. The parent DAG (which the `G002` shape already polices)
  is the authority; L3 derives latest from it.
- **The supersession-fork refusal becomes an arbitration point at merge.**
  One-superseder-per-decision is a write-time refusal in L1; when two sides
  each superseded the same decision independently, merge cannot refuse
  retroactively — it surfaces the fork as a conflict for a named acceptor,
  per this section's stance.

---

## 8. Coverage

The operation git cannot perform, and the reason the graph store is not optional.

```
coverage(set S) = |{d ∈ S : disposition(d) ≠ ∅}| / |S|
```

Reported by allocation, by discharge stage, and by acceptance freshness. Also reported: decisions with a discharge stage *later* than their ground allows (waste — see the ground table in the companion pipeline document) and *earlier* than their ground allows (fiction).

**The honest limit, stated in every coverage report:** coverage is measured against the *enumerated* set. Nothing verifies the set itself. Enumeration completeness has no mechanical check; late-discovery rate (§10) is a lagging proxy. This is the load-bearing gap in the whole design and the report must not imply otherwise.

---

## 9. Integration

### 9.1 Toolchain (companion document covers .NET/Bicep in detail)

- **Roslyn analyzer `DEC001`** — escape sites (`catch (Exception)`, `!`, `#pragma warning disable`) must cite a `dec:` id; a build task validates the id exists and is not expired
- **CI gates** — `ledger verify --gate readiness` before produce; `--gate completeness` before release
- **`PublicAPI.Shipped.txt` and Verify `.approved.txt`** — existing attributed acceptance ledgers in .NET; import as discharge refs rather than duplicating
- **Production discharge** — decisions with `discharge-stage: prod` carry an OTel metric ref and a stated expectation; a scheduled reconcile joins observed against expected and opens findings

### 9.2 Git

Commit trailers carry change-set references so `git log` and `ledger log` can be correlated. **Git is the deposition and distribution mechanism, not the ledger.** No git-notes dependency (they do not propagate by default and are routinely lost).

### 9.3 Model actors

Models may propose enumerations, allocations, and discharge procedures — this is recognition-over-recall on an artifact, the low-transfer-floor direction, and the right task shape for a model.

**Acceptance cannot be delegated.** The residual must land on an actor pinnable finely enough for the assurance level. Route acceptance to a model and the composite becomes pinnable only distributionally, at which point outcome-accountability is *unavailable*, not merely absent. The store enforces this: `accepted-by` must resolve to a human identity. Model-proposed entries land in the staging area and require `ledger accept` by a named human.

Precommitment at class level (`ledger accept --class`) is how human load falls without accountability leaving. Delegation is not.

### 9.4 Upstream basis manifest (federation configuration)

Repos base their claims and decisions on other repos' canon. The corpus itself is the motivating
instance, five levels deep: `product-cli → product-framework → ai-foundation-development →
decision-driven-design → actor-general determination` — the Stable Dependency Principle at repo
scale: dependencies point from volatile toward stable, acyclic by construction.

A repo declares its bases in a local **upstreams manifest** (`.decisions/upstreams.yaml`):

```yaml
upstreams:
  - repo: https://github.com/Hafeok/decision-driven-design
    pin: <commit SHA>          # content-addressed; the basis. Never a branch.
    ref: main                  # readable, advisory only
    provides: [DDD-, pred/, dec:ddd.]   # namespace prefixes; no two upstreams may overlap
```

Rules:

- **Pin by SHA.** "Based on X@main" is a basis that mutates under you; a SHA is a basis. Same
  law as acceptance-signs-hash, one level up.
- **Transitive resolution with a lockfile.** Resolving a repo walks its upstreams' own manifests
  upward and flattens into `upstreams.lock`. When two paths pin *different* SHAs of the same
  upstream — the diamond — that is a **basis conflict**: surfaced as a finding for a named human,
  never auto-resolved. §7's merge stance, applied between repos.
- **Basis-cone loading, not repo loading.** From any entry, walk `based_on`/`depends_on` edges
  upward through the pinned SHAs and load only the entries reached. "Everything at a given
  level" is that walk rendered; five levels never means five full graphs.
- **Offline-first.** A content-addressed clone cache keyed by SHA; no network at verify time;
  explicit `ledger upstreams refresh` is the only fetch. The pinned corpus is reproducible on any
  machine — the byte-identical rebuild test extends across repos.
- **Cross-repo drift is basis loss at repo granularity.** Pinned SHA ≠ current head *and* an
  entry you base on changed status or content in between → a `report escapes` finding, computed
  by the same hash comparison as in-repo pins. One law, three granularities: claim pins,
  decision pins, repo pins.
- **Publishing is pinning's dual.** Promotion to a shared catalog is publishing a repo that
  downstreams pin — no catalog service. This resolves the ddd PRD's `shared/` open note.

### 9.5 Acceptance workbench (the ledger's client)

The principal is the arrangement's scarcest actor and currently has its worst interface: a linear
chat transcript — proposer-optimised, session-bound, no overview, no queue, no diff. The
workbench corrects the allocation. It is a **client of the ledger, never a second store**: every
mutation it performs — accept (sign the content hash), edit-then-accept, reject with reason,
defer-with-price, promote status, set cadence — is an append through §4's discipline. It differs
in kind from `ddd render` (a read-only projection artifact): the workbench is interactive, and
its every write is a ledger entry.

Surfaces, in priority order:

1. **Queues** — staged entries awaiting acceptance, batch diffs against prior versions, expiring
   acceptances, cadence-due revalidations, basis-loss and upstream-drift findings, standing
   priced escapes. Acceptance work is queue work; the tree is context.
2. **The cross-repo tree** — claims status-coloured, decisions with `based_on` edges and pin
   health, supersession chains, rendered as the basis-cone walk over §9.4's pinned upstreams,
   rooted where the principal is working.
3. **LLM as staff, never as the centre** — verify a boundary clause against its cited ground,
   summarise a batch, draft rejection wording, answer "what breaks if I retire this" by graph
   query, propose cadences. The inversion of a coding session: the human is the primary actor;
   models are clerks. Acceptance remains non-delegable per §9.3 regardless of what the staff
   drafted.

Delivery: local-first web app extending the workspace's existing served-graph pattern
(`product mcp --http` + SSE) over multi-repo roots. **Interim, available now:** the git-native
staging discipline makes a PR review surface a v0 workbench — per-entry files, per-line comments
as rejection reasons, merge as acceptance. Crude but queue-shaped; curation sessions run on it
until L5 ships.

**The second interim affordance, on the CLI rather than the PR surface:** `ledger accept
--group|--set` (2026-08-13). It batches the *invocation* over a selection `ledger show` already
resolves — enumerated once, pinned by a manifest hash, printed, and written only against an
explicit confirmation carrying that manifest. It batches nothing else: N decisions produce N
acceptance records, each signing its own version hash, each through the same per-member gate a
single accept runs, and a member the record itself marks unsettled stops the whole run. It is
recorded here as interim, next to the PR surface and for the same reason: a queue-shaped verb is
not a workbench, and naming it one would let the two-line loop it replaces stand in for the
queue, the tree, and the staff that §9.5 actually describes.

## 10. Instruments

Five numbers. Without them the tool is ceremony.

| Instrument | Definition | Reads on |
|---|---|---|
| **Late-discovery rate** | Decisions added to a set *after* its readiness gate, by stage | Enumeration quality. The headline number. Should fall with practice on a task type. |
| **Escape-conversion rate** | Priced escapes that proved governing and moved to `constraint`/`criterion` | Whether the ledger is alive or an accreting footgun list |
| **Analyzer-vs-human catch ratio** | Escape classes caught mechanically vs. in review | Descent measure of the encode–exercise loop |
| **Actor-substitution delta** | Swap the model, re-run, measure degradation | Demand riding on a model prior rather than sitting in a store. Periodic audit; the only instrument that catches this failure mode. |
| **Override-rate per set** | Share of a set's members carrying an up-only tolerance override (§4.2.1) | Whether the set's floor is drawn where consequence actually lives. A high rate is a finding about the decomposition, not the authors. |

---

## 11. Milestones

Prefixed **L0–L6** — the ddd tool's track keeps M1–M8 (its kickoff prompts shipped under those
names); unprefixed "M*n*" in any cross-document reference means the ddd track.

**L0 — Format and gate. SHIPPED 2026-08-10.** File schema, canonicalisation, hashing, `verify`. No graph, no merge. Deliverable: a CI gate that fails on unallocated decisions, incomplete escapes, and expired acceptances. *This alone is usable and carries a large share of the value.* Implemented as the `ledger-core` / `ledger-cli` workspace members; the format is specified independently in `ledger-format-v1.md` (the document the Org Ledger imports) with its migration record in `ledger-format-migrations.md`. The gate fails for a schema fault plus nine classes and nothing else; pendency is status, not a violation.

**L1 — Local operations. SHIPPED 2026-08-10.** `declare`, `add`, `allocate`, `escape`, `revise`, `supersede`, `accept`, `revoke`, `status`, `log`, `blame` — every verb a thin shell over the gate: it builds its change-set, runs the same `verify` pass over the store-as-it-would-be, and refuses any write that introduces a finding (same class, same message; no second validation copy). ULID minting with injectable time/entropy; identity from git config per OD-3. Shipped with spec v1.1 (`L010`, the judgment-actor gap closed by the principal's ruling). Deferred from the original row: semantic `diff` (needs store-at-revision loading — L3's merge base), and `accept --class` operational semantics (the row never listed it; the scope field parses per format v1). The open tension on precommitment, noted here because this row owns it: a class-scoped acceptance still signs one version hash — §9.3's precommitment promises acceptance over a *class* of entries, but §4's law is that acceptance signs a content hash, and no hash ranges over future members of a class. Settling what `--class` mechanically signs is part of its deferred semantics. **Extended
2026-08-13** with `accept --group|--set`: a batched *invocation* over an enumerated, manifest-pinned
selection (§9.5's second interim affordance). It deliberately leaves the precommitment tension
exactly where this row states it — the verb signs present members, enumerated at run time, and no
hash it produces ranges over a future member of anything.

**L2 — Graph and coverage. SHIPPED 2026-08-10.** Embedded RDF index (`index/ledger.ttl`, byte-deterministic Turtle over the log), PROV-O acceptance provenance, `based_on` read as open-vocabulary graph edges, SHACL-style shape checks (`G001`–`G003`, a distinct `verify` stage outside the file gate's closed ten), `coverage` with the seven-state disposition vocabulary per set/namespace plus walkable supersession chains, `reindex` with the byte-identical rebuild test in CI. Built on `product-core`'s oxigraph/SPARQL infrastructure per OD-2 — `ledger-core` still has no direct graph dependency.

**L3 — Merge. SHIPPED 2026-08-11.** Per-decision merge base, conflict classes from §7, no
auto-resolution. Scope inherited from the L1+L2 report, delivered as ruled: merge reconciles
divergent *version chains*, not files; "latest" derives from the parent DAG rather than ULID
order (retiring L1's single-writer leak; graph stage `G004` names a forked chain, `G005` a
competing supersession); the one-superseder-per-decision write refusal became an arbitration
point at merge (§7); semantic `diff <ref>..<ref>` landed on store-at-revision loading. Merge is
two mechanisms: a git merge driver for `.decisions/**` (`ledger merge --install`) settles the
mechanical majority and refuses judgment cases non-zero with the conflict preserved, and
`ledger merge --resolve` presents each conflict — both chains, the common parent, the
consequences — and records the arbitration as an ordinary act (spec v1.3 / format 2: the
reconciled version closes the other tip via `merged_from`, hashed, with every format-1 digest
unchanged). Acceptances never survive reconciliation: a reconciled version awaits a fresh
signature, always. `ledger merge <ref>` is the read-only plan; every arbitration passes the
same delta-gate — file classes and graph classes — as any other write.

**L4 — Federation and instruments.** The upstreams manifest and lockfile (§9.4): SHA-pinned
transitive resolution, basis-cone loading, diamond surfacing, cross-repo drift in `report`
findings; cross-namespace fetch for seam decisions; `instruments`; toolchain integrations
(analyzer, OTel reconcile).

**L5 — Acceptance workbench.** The §9.5 client: queues, cross-repo tree over the basis cone,
LLM-as-staff, every mutation a ledger append. Signing UX per OD-3. Until it ships, curation runs
on the PR-review interim.

**L6 — Certificate-based acceptance signing. RULED 2026-08-11; UNIMPLEMENTED.**
The §4.5 rulings, delivered: spec v1.5 / `format: 4` with the reserved
`signature` field live; payload canonicalisation for signatures (the
canonical acceptance payload — decision id, version hash, actor, signing
timestamp — detached signature over it, never over a commit); the three git
formats (`gpg.format` openpgp | ssh | x509, X.509 as the Entra bridge to the
org product); tier gating (signature required above the tolerance floor —
T2 signed, T1 claimed — riding OD-4's up-only floor so the requirement
cannot be shopped out of); trust-root entries in the ledger with an
explicitly-named genesis entry; revocation-as-finding (validity judged at
signing time); and the verification wiring for `L011`/`L012` (ten file-gate
classes become twelve by the `L010` mechanism). **No code exists for any of
this** — no format v1.4 parsing, no signature verification, no classes
wired; §4.5 plus this row is the whole deliverable so far, and an L6
session should be promptable from the PRD alone. Open sub-questions that
session must settle: whether the signature payload reuses §4-of-the-format's
canonicalisation or takes a distinct domain-separation prefix; where
allowed-signers entries live in the store layout; whether X.509 chain
validation runs in-process or shells out to git.

## 12. Open decisions

Named, not filled. Each should be settled before the milestone that depends on it.

- **OD-1 — Relationship to `decision-cli` (`dec`).** `decision-cli` is the execution-side orchestration harness. This tool is a record-side store. They share a domain and possibly a binary. Options: subcommand of `dec`, sibling binary sharing a Rust crate, or fully separate. Blocks naming and L0 packaging. *Leaning, not settled: sibling workspace member sharing crates, consistent with the ddd tool's delivery decision — requires the `dec` context to confirm.*
- **OD-2 — Relationship to `product-cli` / `.product/`. RESOLVED 2026-08-04.** The ledger is a workspace member of the `product-cli` repo, its RDF materialized view built on the same `product-core` graph infrastructure the ddd tool reuses (Oxigraph-class store, SHACL, PROV-O). `.decisions/` log remains the source of truth; the index stays rebuildable — the byte-identical rebuild test is unchanged. `.product/` is neither replaced nor consumed: it keeps its own ontology. The ddd tool's `.ddd/decisions/` was the **bootstrap form**; the ddd M8 migration (2026-08-12) retired it as the record — decisions, seam declarations, and the risk-acceptance record became `dec:hafeok.ddd/…` entries (manifest entries absorbed as `analyzer:` discharges on their governing decisions; seams discharged by the `contract:` scheme, spec v1.4 / format 3), all allocated-awaiting-acceptance, with the `.ddd` files remaining as content artifacts pinned by `ddd-content:` hashes and `.ddd/concordance.yaml` carrying the permanent id aliases. The ddd basis-pin (claim status + `changed` at decision time) is superseded by content-hash references — basis loss is pinned-hash ≠ current-hash, mechanically exact. Basis: the sibling-on-`product-core` decision and the store-philosophy match (source-of-truth files, derived graph), both settled in the ddd PRD.
- **OD-3 — Signing. RESOLVED 2026-08-10 (principal: Emil).** `accepted-by` is a
  **claimed identity, trust-on-review**, sourced from git config at accept time. There is no
  `--as` override: changing identity means changing git config, one source of truth. **Identity
  resolves by email**, not by display name — §4.4 requires `accepted-by` to *resolve* to a human
  identity, and an address resolves where a display name decorates; it also makes the blame check
  robust against the punctuation drift real `user.name` values carry. Two mechanical
  corroborations carry the load a signature would: (a) an acceptance's `accepted-by` must match
  the commit author of the commit that introduced it — mismatch is a failure, the ninth verify
  class; (b) the never-a-model-identity rule extends to CI and bot identities. An optional,
  schema-reserved `signature` field — format unspecified, empty at L0 — keeps the cryptographic
  upgrade additive rather than a migration. The org product resolves identity properly via Entra;
  the dev product does not pretend to. Two limits are stated in `ledger-format-v1.md` rather than
  hidden: the model-identity list is a floor and not a proof, and an acceptance with no
  introducing commit is *skipped*, never failed — otherwise no acceptance could ever be
  committed. Shipped in L0 as classes `L006` and `L009`. *Upgrade scheduled 2026-08-11:
  §4.5 / L6 populate the reserved `signature` field with certificate-based, tier-gated
  signing (spec v1.5 / `format: 4`). Claimed identity was always the L0 answer and the
  reserved field was the planned door — L6 walks through it. A scheduled stage of this
  resolution, not a reversal of it.*
- **OD-4 — Tolerance granularity. RESOLVED 2026-08-10 (principal: Emil).** Per-set **floor** with
  per-decision **up-only override** (§4.2.1). Below-floor states are unrepresentable rather than
  policed; effective tier is hashed content; floor-raising re-opens stranded acceptances;
  override-rate-per-set is the drawn-wrong-floor instrument. Supersedes the original per-set vs
  per-decision framing: the answer is both, ordered. The org product's OD-4 (step-up mapping)
  inherits: shopping out of step-up auth is likewise unrepresentable.
- **OD-5 — Seam decision ownership.** When a decision crosses two namespaces, who accepts? Both? A designated owner? Blocks L4.
- **OD-6 — Expiry default.** Is `expires-at` mandatory, defaulted, or optional? Mandatory forces re-acceptance churn; optional lets acceptances go stale silently.
- **OD-7 — Tolerance change protocol.** Changing a set's tier invalidates every escape acceptance made against the old consequence. Is that automatic invalidation or a prompted review? Also: what triggers a mandatory re-declaration (first payment, first PII, first external consumer, first SLA)?

## 13. Falsifiers

How we would know this is wrong, rather than merely unadopted.

- **Late-discovery rate does not fall** with practice on a repeated task type → enumeration is not a learnable skill at this granularity, or the tolerance tiers are mis-specified. Core to the whole design.
- **Escape-conversion rate stays near zero** while late-discovery stays flat → the ledger is an accreting footgun list, not a converging loop. Predicted specifically for teams with strong containment infrastructure, where cheap escape removes the pressure that produced enumeration.
- **Coverage correlates with nothing** — no relationship between disposition coverage and incident rate at matched tolerance → the denominator is wrong.
- **Merge conflicts are rare and boring** → decisions are not actually contested across branches, and per-decision merge base was over-engineering. Git's model would have sufficed.
- **Acceptance load does not fall** as precommitment classes accumulate → the asymptote (acceptance per novel decision class, not per run) is unreachable and the human bottleneck is structural rather than granular.
- **Ledger drifts from code** despite living in the same reviewed unit → co-location is insufficient and the binding must be mechanical (every code change touching a cited decision requires a ledger touch).
- **Diamond conflicts are frequent and noisy** across a small corpus under one principal → SHA-pinning at repo granularity is too coarse for how basis actually flows, and pinning belongs at entry granularity instead.
- **Acceptance throughput does not beat the PR-review interim** once the workbench ships → the bottleneck was never the interface, and the queue/tree design misread where principal demand concentrates.

## 14. One-paragraph summary for a cold session

Build a version-control system for governing decisions. Decisions have repo-independent stable IDs and content-hashed versions; acceptance signs a hash and is performed only by a named human. Files in git are the append-only log; an embedded RDF graph is a rebuildable materialized view whose sole purpose is answering coverage — "which decisions in this declared set have no disposition" — a claim about absence that git cannot express. Take git's local-first, content-addressed, branchable, blame-able interaction model; reject tree-snapshot commits, textual diff, textual merge, and rewritable history. Merge is per-decision with a per-decision merge base, and conflicting allocations are always a question for a named acceptor, never an automatic resolution. Ship L0 first — schema plus a CI gate that fails on unallocated decisions and expired acceptances — because it is usable alone. The known load-bearing gap: coverage is measured against the enumerated set, and nothing verifies the set.
