// D-33 — WITHDRAWN by ruling R-Q10. There was an `IPlaceOrderHandler` interface here so
// that an unroled egress decorator could sit between the controller and the handler,
// because the profile gave the write position no home. The ruling gives the write to the
// provider role, so the decorator is gone and with it the indirection: the controller now
// depends on this concrete type, and the profile's "calls exactly one type declaring the
// handler role for the same act instance" is true at run time and not only in source
// text. The ruling closed an evasion vector as a side effect of closing a hole.

/// Q-03 IS LIVE IN THIS FILE AND IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONFLICT IN THE RUN.
/// The profile permits rejection "only for invariants the FACT VOCABULARY declares".
/// `ordering.eventmodel.yaml` declares ids, kinds and two prose notes. It declares no
/// invariant, no predicate, no constraint, and no field one could be stated over. Read
/// strictly, this handler may never reject, `Rejected` is dead, and the controller's
/// Accepted-or-Rejected mapping is half unreachable.
/// Both rejections below come from the DETERMINATION layer, not the fact vocabulary:
/// DSC-0001 (pinned, `settled_by: "invariant:CartNotEmpty"`) and DSC-0005. Implementing
/// them violates the profile rule as written. Not implementing them ignores a pinned
/// determination addressed to this exact act.
/// This session implements them and reports the violation, on the reading that the rule
/// means "invariants declared over the fact vocabulary" and that "fact vocabulary" is
/// loose for the specification as a whole. That reading is not in the text. Q-03.
///
/// D-18 — DECIDED: rejection ORDER. DSC-0001 is checked before DSC-0005. Nothing
/// settles precedence between two rejections that can both apply to one cart, and the
/// caller sees only the first. A cart that is both empty and mis-currencied reports
/// CartNotEmpty. Reversing it is equally supported by the specification.
///
/// SETTLED by DSC-0003 — AUTHORITY IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT BELOW.
/// "Who may place an order is not settled at this address", allocation `residual`,
/// carried_by `human`, principal team `platform-security`. So there is no authorisation
/// check in this handler, and its absence is a reading of the specification rather than
/// an oversight. The residual is live and someone carries it. Q-17.
///
/// D-37 — DECIDED, AND CAUGHT LATE. The entry point is SYNCHRONOUS. Nothing in any
/// input settles whether a handler is sync or async, whether a CancellationToken is
/// propagated, or what an async decision would mean for "performs I/O directly". The
/// Gate A expectation list predicted this one (item 7) and this session then decided it
/// and failed to mark it; the omission was found while writing the Gate C report, not
/// by any check. That failure mode — a predicted invention resolved silently — is
/// exactly what the instrumentation exists to prevent, and it happened once here.
///
/// NOT SETTLED ANYWHERE, AND NOT DONE (see decisions.md):
///   * the cart is not emptied. `PlaceOrder` writes `OrderPlaced` and nothing else; the
///     act vocabulary gives `CartEmptied` to `EmptyCart`. So a placed order leaves its
///     cart standing. This session believes that is wrong and implements it as
///     specified. Q-15.
///   * no idempotency and no concurrency control. Two calls place two orders. Q-23.
