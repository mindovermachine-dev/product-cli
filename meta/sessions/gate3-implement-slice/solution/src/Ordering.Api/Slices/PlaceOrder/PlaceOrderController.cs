/// D-21 — INVENTED, AND THIS IS THE LARGEST SINGLE HOLE THIS RUN FOUND IN THE PROFILE.
/// "Returns a transport result DERIVED FROM the handler's Accepted or Rejected" names a
/// dependency and not a function. Nothing anywhere in the four inputs states the HTTP
/// status for an accepted command, the status for a rejected one, whether a Location
/// header is owed, or what the response body is. Every line of the mapping below is
/// this session's invention:
///     Accepted            -> 201 Created, Location: /orders/{OrderId}, body = the event
///     Rejected            -> 422 Unprocessable Entity, ProblemDetails citing the invariant
///     invalid payload     -> 400 Bad Request  (DSC-0002; see D-23)
///     read position gone  -> mapped by unroled middleware (see Unroled/), not here
/// 200 / 202 for Accepted and 400 / 409 for Rejected are all equally consistent with
/// the specification. Two readers produce two incompatible APIs from one profile and
/// both conform. Q-12, Q-13.
///
/// D-22 — DECIDED. Rejections map to ONE status regardless of which invariant was
/// cited. Branching per invariant would be "a conditional on domain state", which the
/// profile forbids the controller. So the invariant travels in the body and never in
/// the status line. That is this session's reading of a must_not whose boundary — does
/// switching on Accepted vs Rejected already count? — the profile does not draw. The
/// profile requires exactly that switch, so it cannot; where the line falls past it is
/// undrawn.
///
/// D-23 — DECIDED. DSC-0002 ("every command slice validates its payload against the
/// domain model's declared types before deciding") is realised HERE and not in the
/// handler, because the handler may reject "only for invariants the fact vocabulary
/// declares" and a payload type fault is not one. But that puts a transport result on a
/// path that is NOT "derived from the handler's Accepted or Rejected", contradicting
/// the controller's own must. One of the two rules gives; this session chose which.
/// Q-09.
///
/// D-24 — INVENTED. Route, verb, the plural noun, the absence of versioning in the path,
/// and the fact that the resource is /orders rather than /place-order. The profile
/// fixes the stack and names the role; it fixes no URL.
