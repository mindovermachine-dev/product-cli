**Session:** `gate3-implement-slice`
**Party:** builder (fresh session; blind to the design per the bundle's prohibitions)
**Branch:** `claude/gate3-slice-impl-woir81`
**Commit identity:** `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` (session-neutral, as the prompt requires)
**Date of first act:** 2026-09-15

## Arrived inputs, filed with sha256 before use

| File | sha256 |
|---|---|
| `inputs/ordering.eventmodel.yaml` | `06d32bfa002ee0d69a22a15c09b767c80d085908bfd374936095c506c8bc87bb` |
| `inputs/place-order.determinations.yaml` | `81ca01cbbdf0e7cd8dcac869467ba7a082cbf7deafbaee0bca333e7a490156dc` |
| `inputs/profile-rest-api-v1.md` | `940c07aec7ffe64345dbcc524e105baaac62ea3ff9db8edeea71845cb0be0beb` |
| `inputs/determination.schema.json` | `4df4db09cf11d9a0cc02b4fee762fb9b71c3194dd1cb59691ccb6cba52fc67c6` |
| `prompt.md` (the session prompt) | `21c4f8402293957d622050fb587ce50504cf28def0c4849af7e4a7e5a24b42da` |

**A fifth input arrived 2026-09-17**, after the build, as move 1 under CG-R-137. It is
supplied as an *input*, not a ruling, and it is `[PROPOSED]`:

| File | sha256 |
|---|---|
| `inputs/ordering.fact-type-space.md` | `0a5e867b4d1b5ddbc8ff3f39809e1f7ca86b2275c477d38413d7040f903e26cf` |

It declares the fields of every fact in `ordering.eventmodel.yaml` — the gap this run
recorded as its largest (Q-07), and the reason `DSC-0002` had been validating this
session's inventions against themselves.

The four input files under `inputs/` are byte-identical copies of the bundle's
`gate3-bundle/inputs/`; `prompt.md` is a byte-identical copy of
`gate3-bundle/session-gate3-implement-slice.md`. Hashes above are of the copies
as committed, and match the bundle as delivered.

## What this session has read, exhaustively

1. The four arrived inputs listed above — except that
   `place-order.determinations.yaml` **has not been opened yet**. See the reading
   order below.
2. `prompt.md`.
3. `CG-R-127` / `CG-R-128` (the rulings that scope this run), supplied alongside
   the bundle by the party that convened the session.

Nothing else about the scheme has been read: no README, no conformance manifest,
no repository, no web search, no prior gate output.

**One prohibition cannot be complied with.** The Standing rules say
*"`canon-governance` holds the in-force rules; read them at the pinned commit and
comply."* `canon-governance` is not in the bundle, no commit is pinned in the
prompt, and the Prohibitions forbid reading anything about the scheme beyond the
four inputs. These two instructions cannot both be satisfied. This session has
complied with the Prohibitions and has **not** read `canon-governance`; the
in-force rules are therefore unread and any rule they carry that is not restated
in the bundle has not been applied. Filed as Q-01 at Gate B.

## Reading order, and why

The prompt gates the Gate A expectation list on *"before reading further into the
determinations than you already have"*. At the moment that gate was reached this
session had read **zero** of `place-order.determinations.yaml`.

Order actually followed, and fixed by the commit sequence:

1. Hash all four inputs. *(done before any content was read)*
2. Read `ordering.eventmodel.yaml`, `profile-rest-api-v1.md`,
   `determination.schema.json` — the act vocabulary, the realisation rules, and
   the shape a determination may take.
3. **Write and commit `gate-a.md`, including the expectation list**, with
   `place-order.determinations.yaml` still unopened.
4. Only then open `place-order.determinations.yaml`.

**This ordering is a decision the prompt does not settle**, and it is recorded
here rather than resolved silently. The alternative reading — write the
expectation list before opening *any* input — would have produced a list
predicting nothing in particular, since with no act vocabulary and no profile
there is nothing to predict a shortfall *against*. The reading taken treats "the
determinations" as naming the one file, and keeps the expectation list a genuine
prediction: what the determinations will fail to settle, written by someone who
knows what needs settling and has not yet looked.

The cost of this choice is stated plainly: the expectation list is better
informed than the strictest reading would allow, so it should score better than
a truly cold prediction would. Weigh it accordingly.

## Where the work lands

Everything for this run lives under `meta/sessions/gate3-implement-slice/`:

```
prompt.md                 the session prompt, verbatim
bootstrap.md              this file
inputs/                   the four arrived inputs, verbatim
gate-a.md                 expectation list, reading of the slice, contradictions
questions.md              every question asked, verbatim, with what prompted it
decisions.md              every decision the specification does not settle
gate-c-report.md          the Gate 3 report
solution/                 the fresh ASP.NET Core solution
```

The host repository is a Rust workspace unrelated to this exercise. Keeping the
greenfield solution inside the session directory is a decision the prompt does
not settle — recorded in `decisions.md` — taken so the run is self-contained and
so no host-repository convention leaks into a slice whose whole point is to be
built from the specification alone.
