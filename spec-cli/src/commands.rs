//! Subcommand surface, mirroring the flow's verbs.
//!
//! Only the non-delegable half is *implemented* here. `import` and `build` are
//! the agent host's: they appear on this surface so that one command name
//! covers the flow, but each one launches a separate executable that links no
//! code able to write a closure. The process boundary is still the
//! accountability boundary; this file is only the front door to both sides of
//! it.
