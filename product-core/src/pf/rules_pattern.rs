//! Strict What-conformance — the graph-level completeness checks (§3.2.0, §3.2.5,
//! §3.4, §4.5) that judge the whole model rather than one mutating node.
//!
//! These are the spec's *verification kinds*, not per-mutation gates: they ask
//! whether the captured What is complete (every flow owned, every command
//! triggered and event-producing, every view consumed, no step stranded on an
//! unreifiable AIO). They run only under `domain validate --strict`, so ordinary
//! authoring is never blocked by an in-progress graph.
