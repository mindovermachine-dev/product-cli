//! Naming what moved when a confirmed manifest no longer matches the store.
//!
//! A refusal that says only "the selection changed" tells a principal to
//! re-read from scratch; one that says *which* entry entered, left, or moved
//! tells them whether the change touches what they just read. Naming it
//! needs the earlier selection, which the manifest hash alone cannot give
//! back — so it is recovered rather than stored.
//!
//! The recovery is sound because the log is append-only: every state this
//! store has passed through is a prefix of its change-sets in ULID order.
//! [`locate`] replays those prefixes until one hashes to the manifest that
//! was confirmed, which reconstructs the exact selection the principal read
//! — no cache, no scratch file, nothing to go stale. When no prefix matches,
//! the refusal says so plainly instead of guessing.
