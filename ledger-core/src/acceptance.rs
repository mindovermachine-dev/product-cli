//! Acceptance — a named human signing an exact version hash (§4.3, §9.3).
//!
//! Acceptance is the entry that compounds, and the one act that cannot be
//! delegated. Models may propose enumerations, allocations and discharge
//! procedures; routing *acceptance* to a model makes the composite pinnable
//! only distributionally, at which point outcome-accountability is
//! unavailable rather than merely absent. So an acceptance names an identity
//! and signs a hash, and verify polices both (classes `L006`, `L008`).
//!
//! Precommitment at class level ([`AcceptanceScope::Class`]) is how human
//! load falls without accountability leaving — an analyzer assignment is
//! exactly that. Delegation is not.
