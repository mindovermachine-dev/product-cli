//! Blame consistency — who actually committed an acceptance (OD-3).
//!
//! `accepted-by` is a claimed identity, so on its own it is a string anyone
//! can type. This is the second mechanical corroboration: the actor an
//! acceptance names must be the author of the commit that introduced it.
//! Git is the deposition mechanism (§9.2), so the attribution it already
//! carries is free evidence, and a mismatch is verify class `L009`.
//!
//! **The limit, stated plainly:** an acceptance that is not yet committed has
//! no introducing commit, so the check is *skipped* rather than failed —
//! otherwise no acceptance could ever be committed in the first place. The
//! check therefore lands on the next run, which in practice is CI. A working
//! tree is not where this rule bites; a pushed branch is.
