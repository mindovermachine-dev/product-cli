//! The closed set of reasons `ledger verify` fails.
//!
//! This enum *is* the file gate's contract. The gate fails for a schema
//! fault or one of fourteen semantic classes, and for nothing else — a new
//! reason is a change to the format specification, not an implementation
//! detail (`L010` arrived exactly that way, as the spec v1.1 amendment,
//! `L013`/`L014` the same way at spec v1.6, and the signing classes
//! `L011`/`L012` — numbers reserved for them since #65, ruling D3 — at
//! spec v1.8).
//! Adding a variant here without a row in `docs/ledger-format-v1.md` is
//! caught by the `every_class_is_specified` test.
//!
//! "Allocated, awaiting acceptance" is deliberately absent. The gate polices
//! violations, not pendency: a decision that is enumerated and allocated but
//! not yet signed is the normal state of work in progress, and reporting it
//! as a failure would train people to ignore the gate.
