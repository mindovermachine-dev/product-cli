//! The enumerated, pinned selection a batched acceptance signs.
//!
//! Batching the *act* is an ergonomic affordance; batching the *signature*
//! would be a change to what acceptance means, and this module exists to
//! keep the two apart. A [`Plan`] is a list of `(decision, version hash)`
//! pairs with what the run would do to each — never a predicate carried
//! forward to write time. A selection that re-evaluates between the read
//! and the run is exactly how an unread entry gets signed, so the plan is
//! enumerated once, hashed, and the hash is what a confirming run must
//! present.
//!
//! The members come from [`crate::show`]'s screens, not from a second
//! traversal. That is structural rather than careful: `ledger show --group
//! X` and `ledger accept --group X` cannot resolve to different sets
//! because they are the same resolution, so what a principal read is
//! provably what a principal signs.
