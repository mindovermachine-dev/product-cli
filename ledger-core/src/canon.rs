//! The canonical form of a version — the bytes a hash is taken over.
//!
//! YAML is the *file* format; canonical JSON is the *hash* form. Routing
//! through a second, restricted serialisation is what makes
//! "formatting-only edits leave the hash unchanged" structural rather than a
//! rule someone has to remember: quoting style, key order, indentation,
//! comments, line endings and `null`-versus-absent all disappear in the
//! parse, before anything is hashed. It also gives an outside implementation
//! — the Org Ledger imports this format — a target with no YAML ambiguity to
//! reproduce: no anchors, no tags, no four ways to write a multi-line scalar.
//!
//! The full specification, including the pinned conformance vector, is
//! `docs/ledger-format-v1.md`. This module is its implementation, not its
//! definition; where they disagree the document wins.
