//! The derived reading of a log that every rule queries.
//!
//! Built once per run so the rules stay declarative: which version is the
//! latest for each decision, which hashes exist, which acceptances are still
//! live. Nothing here is cached to disk — L0 has no index, and a view
//! rebuilt from the log every run is exactly the property §5's rebuild test
//! exists to protect.
//!
//! **Latest derives from the parent DAG, never from ULID order.** ULIDs
//! order by one clock, and two writers' clocks prove nothing about
//! parenthood: the latest version of a decision is the unique version no
//! other version of the same decision names as `parent`. A chain with more
//! than one such tip is *forked* — two writers diverged — which the graph
//! stage reports as `G004` and only `ledger merge --resolve` may settle.
//! For a forked decision the map still holds a deterministic representative
//! (the tip with the lexically smallest hash — clock-free, so the reading
//! is stable under any file ordering), but nothing may treat that pick as
//! a resolution: the store is non-conformant until a human arbitrates.
//!
//! Assembling each wire version into its domain form happens here too, so a
//! file that cannot describe a version reports once rather than once per
//! rule that trips over it.
