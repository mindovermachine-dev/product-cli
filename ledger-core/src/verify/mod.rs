//! The gate — the whole of L0's checking surface.
//!
//! One pass over the log produces every finding: the parse gate, then the
//! twelve classes. Failing for exactly those reasons is the format's measure of
//! success, so the orchestration here is deliberately flat — there is no
//! place for a rule to hide.
//!
//! Pendency is not a violation. A decision that is enumerated and allocated
//! but not yet signed is the normal state of work in progress; it is
//! reported as status, never as a failure, because a gate that fires on
//! ordinary work is a gate people learn to ignore.
