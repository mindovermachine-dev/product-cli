//! Rules over what a decision is allocated to, at what tier, by whom.
//!
//! Five of the twelve classes: `L001` unallocated, `L003` expired acceptance,
//! `L005` stranded below a raised floor, `L006` an acceptor who is not an
//! accountable actor, `L010` a judgment exercised by one. `L002` and `L004`
//! are raised earlier — an unpriced escape and a below-floor override are
//! unrepresentable in the domain type, so they surface when the wire form is
//! assembled rather than here.
