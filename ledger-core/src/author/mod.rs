//! The L1 authoring verbs — thin shells over the gate.
//!
//! Every verb builds the change-set (or set file) it intends to append, runs
//! the *same* [`crate::verify::verify`] pass the CI gate runs over the store
//! as it would look afterwards, and refuses to write if any finding appears
//! that the store did not already carry. There is no second copy of the
//! rules anywhere in this module: a verb can only refuse for exactly what
//! `verify` would report, one command later, with the same class and the
//! same message. The one sanctioned exception is `add` without an
//! allocation, which is the enumerated-but-unallocated intermediate state
//! the format explicitly represents (`L001` is then the gate doing its job,
//! not a write fault).
//!
//! The log stays append-only: verbs only ever create new files
//! (`log/<ulid>.yml`, `sets/<id>.yml`), never edit one.
