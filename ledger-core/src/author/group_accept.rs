//! `ledger accept --group` — one invocation, one acceptance record per
//! decision.
//!
//! What is batched is the act. Each member still gets its own [`Acceptance`]
//! signing its own version hash, under the same [`AcceptanceScope::Version`]
//! a single accept uses: the binding is untouched, and every signature this
//! verb produces is exactly as bound as one typed on its own. There is no
//! shared record, no class scope, no hash ranging over members — a shortcut
//! that produced one record covering N decisions would be a different
//! meaning of acceptance wearing this verb's name.
//!
//! Three refusals stand between a selection and a signature, and none of
//! them is a batch-only leniency in the other direction. The selection must
//! still hash to the manifest a prior read enumerated; no member may be held
//! or forked; and every member runs the *same* delta-gate a single accept
//! runs — once alone, so a failure can be attributed, and once combined, so
//! the write is checked as the act it is.
