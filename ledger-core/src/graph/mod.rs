//! The L2 graph — a materialised, disposable view of the log.
//!
//! The log is the source of truth; this module derives from it and never
//! feeds back. Three pieces: [`turtle`] emits the RDF view (byte-
//! deterministic, so `reindex` after deletion reproduces the index
//! byte-identically — the PRD §5 correctness test), [`index`] writes it
//! under `.decisions/index/`, and [`shapes`] runs the SPARQL shape checks
//! for cross-entry invariants the per-file gate cannot name. The SPARQL
//! engine is `product-core`'s (OD-2): oxigraph stays that crate's
//! dependency, never this one's.
//!
//! Graph findings are a **distinct stage** of `verify`, outside the file
//! gate's closed classes: `G001`–`G006`, reported by the same command
//! with unchanged exit semantics.
//!
//! The same triples also serialise as sorted N-Triples ([`ntriples`]),
//! which is the committed per-namespace export ([`export`]) the analyzers'
//! generator reads; `verify --export` holds it byte-identical to the log.
