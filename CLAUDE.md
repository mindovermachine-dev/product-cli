# CLAUDE.md — Product CLI

## What is this project?

Product is a Rust CLI and MCP server for the **Product Framework** — the open
What/How specification graph (`docs/product-framework-open.md`, currently
v1.9.1). It captures and verifies a product's *What* (domain model, event model,
Deciders, Projectors, systems, triggers, UI/AIO model) and *How* (contracts,
reification, delivery), all under `.product/`. Every product has one home,
`.product/products/<name>/`; the reference What lives in
`.product/products/product-cli/`.

> **Graph-only.** This repo was pivoted to the framework graph alone. The former
> FT/ADR/TC knowledge-graph tool (the `adr`/`test`/`gap`/`drift`/`conformance`/
> `implement`/`verify` commands, `docs/{features,adrs,tests}`, and the meta-graph
> engine) has been removed. Don't reach for those commands or dirs. Note the
> current `product feature` command is unrelated — it is the §7.1 **delivery
> feature** (see *Vocabulary* below), not the old FT-XXX artifact.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build                                          # compile
cargo t                                              # full suite, runs every binary (alias in .cargo/config.toml)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used   # lint (zero unwrap policy)
```

**Always run `cargo t`, never plain `cargo test`.** Plain `cargo test` stops at
the first failing binary and skips the rest. The `t` alias is `test
--no-fail-fast` (`.cargo/config.toml`): it runs every test binary and reports
the complete result set at the end.

Suite composition (~500 tests):

| Binary | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `cargo test -p product-core --lib` | pf unit tests (the framework graph, in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) |
| `cargo test -p product-mcp` | MCP registry + framework tool handlers (stateless + phase-gated session) |
| `--test framework` | `assert_cmd`-driven framework CLI scenarios (`tests/framework.rs`) |
| `--test code_quality_tests` | fitness gates: file length ≤ 400, function length, SRP, module structure |
| `product-core/tests/property` | `proptest` over fileops/init |

All three gates (build, `cargo t`, clippy) must pass before any commit.
Code-quality fitness tests (`tests/code_quality_tests.rs`) enforce a
400-line-per-file hard limit and a single-responsibility check on module doc
comments (the first `//!` line must not contain the word "and").

### Rust toolchain

The toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` at the repo root. `rustup`
reads this automatically, so `cargo` / `cargo clippy` always run on the
pinned version locally. CI (`dtolnay/rust-toolchain@master`) reads the same
file, so local and CI stay in lockstep. To upgrade, bump the `channel`
value in `rust-toolchain.toml` — no workflow change needed.

## Project Structure

This repo is a Cargo workspace with three publishable members and one
internal `xtask` helper (FT-107).

```

`pf::paths::product_base` resolves a product's home; two legacy layouts still
resolve for unmigrated repos (root-product artifacts directly under `.product/`,
What graphs under `.product/author-domain/<name>/`) — the fallback only fires
when the scoped home doesn't exist. `product product {new,list,show}` (and the
`product_product_*` MCP tools) manage the homes.

A blueprint's `how-contract.yaml` may be an inline contract **or** a one-line
`ref: <relative path>` stub pointing at a shared one — resolved by
`HowContract::load_opt` (one hop, relative to the stub). The self-hosted
`blueprints/product-cli/` uses `ref: ../../how-contract.yaml` so the repo has a
single canonical How; `product blueprint init` still scaffolds a full inline
contract for a genuinely standalone blueprint.

**Downstream consumers** (e.g. `decision-cli`) should add only:

```toml
[dependencies]
product-core = { path = "../product-cli/product-core" }   # or a git rev
```

This buys the `pf/` framework graph and `ProductError` without
pulling in `clap`, `axum`, `tower-http`, or the `product` binary.

## Vocabulary — three senses of "slice" (don't conflate them)

The framework (§7.1) fixes the delivery containment **feature ⊇ flow ⊇ slice**.
The word "slice" is overloaded across the repo — keep the three apart:

- **§7.1 feature** — a *reference to a subgraph* of one or more flows: the
  `Feature` struct (`pf/feature.rs`), the `product feature` command, the
  `product_feature_*` MCP tools, stored under `.product/features/*.yaml`. This is
  the delivery unit that was formerly (mis)named "slice". A **deliverable** wraps
  a feature and adds shippable acceptance/runner; a **release** partitions
  deliverables.
- **atomic slice = work unit (§5, §3.2.0)** — a single pattern instance
  (Trigger → Command → Decider → Events, or a View + the events it reads): the
  `product_work_unit_*` tools, stored under `.product/work-units/`. A flow is a
  connected chain of these.
- **vertical slice (architecture)** — the *module-organization* pattern below
  ("Slice + Adapter"): a pure `pf/` module + a thin CLI adapter. Nothing to do
  with delivery; it is how the code is laid out.

Back-compat: the old `slice` on-disk key and CLI/MCP argument still load —
`Deliverable.feature` carries `#[serde(alias = "slice")]`, CLI `--feature` has
`alias = "slice"`, and the delivery MCP handlers fall back to the `slice`/`slices`
keys.

## Working with the framework graph

Use the `product` CLI (or MCP tools) to author and verify a What/How graph under
`.product/`:

- **Author the What** — `product domain new <kind> <id> …` captures domain nodes
  (entity, command, event, read-model, ui-step, **system**, trigger, **product**
  (§3.0 root owning domains+systems), **journey** (§3.0.1 cross-system flow
  composition), **quality-demand** (§3.6 runtime-bound / architectural NFR), …);
  `product domain show/list` inspects them; `product domain export` emits Turtle.
  A **system** must also declare its §3.2.5 sub-kind: `product domain new system
  <id> --system-kind service|application|website|cli --purpose … ` (the top-level
  `<kind>` selects the node *type*; `--system-kind` sets the system's own `kind`).
- **Validate** — `product domain validate` runs the per-node §3.1/§3.2 shapes;
  `product domain validate --strict` adds the graph-level completeness checks
  (flow ownership §3.2.5, the Command pattern §3.2.0, view consumption §3.4, the
  unreifiable seam §4.5, **journey conformance §3.0.1** — every crossing a
  Translation — and, when a How contract is present, that an architectural
  quality demand's `constrains` binds a real How element §3.6).
- **Make behaviour executable** — `product decider derive <aggregate>` derives a
  Decider's signature from the event model; `product decider validate <id>` runs
  the §3.3 drift rules + the state/Decider justification detectors;
  `product decider simulate` runs its scenarios. `product projector …` is the §3.4
  read-model peer.
- **Realise it** — `product how`, `product feature`, `product build`, `product seam`,
  `product preview` cover the How contract, delivery features, and the screen seam.
  `product feature new <id> --anchor <node>…` saves a §7.1 feature (a subgraph
  pointer; its build-context is *assembled from the model*, never restated).
  `product how set version|realises-version --id <v>` carries the §7.3 semantic
  versions (a How declares which What-version it realises).
- **Design system (§11)** — `product design-system add <manifest>` vendors a §11.3
  manifest (declaration + implementation bundle: per-target component sources, token
  values per theme, templates) under `.product/design-systems/<id>/`; `validate` /
  `couple` are the wholeness + §11.2 coverage checks; `bind <id>` records the choice
  on the How contract (§4.5). Once bound, every `product codegen` backend gates on the
  coupling at plan time and emits `design-system.g.json` + `tokens.g.css` (hash-pinned;
  `reify check` catches design-system drift), and `product codegen web` renders one
  on-system HTML page per UI step, styled exclusively via tokens.
- **Authoring scopes (§14)** — `product scope add <file>` validates a tool's
  authoring-scope declaration (§14.2 — which What-element kinds it MAY author,
  which it MUST NOT, over the framework's own kind vocabulary) and vendors it under
  `.product/authoring-scopes/<tool>.yaml`. A scope makes a tool (Figma, a legacy
  schema, an Event-Modeling board) a **bounded co-author** of the What. `list` /
  `show` / `validate` inspect stored scopes (validate = wholeness + kind-vocabulary
  + the derived-kind rule: a derived kind like `state-space` never appears in
  `authors`). `scope enforce <tool> <submission.json>` runs the §14.3 enforcement
  oracle — in-scope authorship accepted, out-of-scope content rejected regardless
  of quality, the gap split into `unauthored-within-scope` vs `outside-scope`.
  `scope join --required <kinds>` (or `--required-file`) runs the §14.4
  completeness join across every stored scope — per required kind: covered (by
  whom), coverable-but-unauthored, or uncovered. A **What-phase** intake concept;
  the reference Figma scope lives at `.product/authoring-scopes/figma.yaml` and the
  schema at `schema/json/authoring-scope/`.
- **DeployableUnit (§4/§4.2)** — `product deployable-unit new <id> --built-from
  <blueprint> --system <sys>… [--environment … --domain-name/--bundle-id/--runtime]`
  declares the concrete artifact a **blueprint** (v1.7.0's rename of *archetype*)
  is instantiated as for a system, carrying its per-environment deployment
  identity. `validate` resolves `built_from` against `.product/blueprints/` and
  each `deploys_system` against the What. Stored under `.product/deployable-units/`;
  a How-phase concept (edges `instantiated_as`/`deploys_system`/`built_from`/
  `carries_identity`). *`archetype` remains a back-compat alias everywhere.*
- **Direction (§7.3)** — `product target new <id> --version <v> --feature <deliverable>…`
  declares a future partition of features; `product target direction <id>`
  computes the gap (the unrealised members) — a query over the graph, not prose.
- **Build seam (§5.1)** — `product build <deliverable> --emit-seam` emits the work
  units as build-seam envelopes (by value + content-hash identity, the outbound
  half); `product verdict <file>` validates an inbound verdict event against the
  pinned accepted/rejected/escalate vocabulary. Schemas: `schema/json/build-seam/`,
  with siblings `schema/json/codegen/` (the code-generation seam §5.2 — codegen
  manifest + file plan) and `schema/json/conformance/` (the §6.3.1 behavioural-
  conformance wire protocol — decision/projection request+response).

The reference What lives in `.product/products/product-cli/`. `product mcp
--http` serves two web views:

- **`/`** — the **1.7.0 explorer** (a React app embedded from
  `product-mcp/src/assets/ui/`, served via a `rust_embed` fallback in
  `http_ui.rs`; React + Babel vendored under `vendor/` so it needs no CDN or
  build step, transpiled in-browser). Six sections — The Graph (§2·§9), The What
  (§3), UI (§3.2), The How (§4, incl. **blueprints + DeployableUnits**), Build
  (§5–6), Delivery (§7, incl. **versions**). *Currently driven by the bundled
  `window.PF` demo data (`assets/ui/data*.js`), not live-wired to `/api/graph`
  yet — that is the follow-up pass.*
- **`/legacy`** — the original self-contained **live** 3-view page (Systems §3.0,
  Domain ER §3.1, Flows / Event-Modeling swimlanes §3.2), projected from
  `/api/graph` (`pf::viz`, gaining a §4 How lane in 1.7.0) and live-refreshed
  over SSE. This is the graph-connected view until the explorer is wired.

## DDD governance (`.ddd/`, the `ddd` binary)

A second workspace stack — `ddd-core` / `ddd-lsp` / `ddd-mcp` / `ddd-cli` —
governs *decisions* over a repo-local `.ddd/` store (predicates, falsifiable
claims, decisions, analyzer/linter manifests, patterns, seams). Separate
ontology, separate store, shared storage conventions
([spec](docs/ddd-v1-spec.md); [umbrella PRD](docs/ddd-cli-prd.md)). `ddd validate | diff | report escapes | why |
render | what | serve`.

**The What is a governed contract surface** (`ddd what`,
`dec/ddd/what-policy-table`). It needs no language server — product-core owns
the What as typed data, so the adapter reads it off `DomainGraph` and runs the
same policy-table mechanism as the C#/Bicep adapters (`ddd-core/src/surface.rs`).

- **Boundary kinds** are surface always: system (§3.2.5), context mapping
  (§3.1), journey crossing (§3.0.1), quality demand (§3.6).
- **Published kinds** are surface only when a §3.2.0 **Translation** carries
  them — the View it watches, the Command it issues, the Events that View
  projects (`dec/ddd/what-published-qualifier`; the unqualified rule was
  measured false and retired as `DDD-what-02`). Everything else is internal.
- A boundary is governed when a seam's `contract_location` is
  `what:<element-id>`.

**Write-time interception** lives at `product-mcp/src/what_intercept.rs`,
inside the existing `RepoLock` in `registry.rs::call_tool_at`: it applies the
edit, classifies before/after, and restores its snapshot when an undeclared
boundary appears. `product_what_declare` files the seam without leaving the
session. Inert unless `.ddd/` exists; mode from
`intercept_by_class.specification`. **MCP write path only** — `product domain
new` on the CLI is not intercepted; `ddd what --strict` is the gate there.

`product-mcp` therefore depends on `ddd-core` (pure library). **`product-core`
must stay ddd-free** — that is the downstream-consumer contract.

## Decision ledger (`.decisions/`, the `ledger` binary)

A third stack — `ledger-core` / `ledger-cli` — is the decision **record
substrate** ([PRD](docs/decision-ledger-prd.md)). L0–L2 shipped: the file
format, the CI gate, the L1 authoring verbs, and the L2 graph. Separate
store (`.decisions/`), separate ontology.

- **Format** — [`docs/ledger-format-v1.md`](docs/ledger-format-v1.md) is
  normative and is what an outside implementation (the Org Ledger) imports;
  the code follows it, not the other way round. Migrations:
  `docs/ledger-format-migrations.md`. Two files: `sets/<id>.yml` declares a
  tolerance **floor**, `log/<ulid>.yml` is an append-only change-set holding
  decisions, versions, acceptances and revocations. Never edit a log file
  after writing it — a correction is a new version, a reversal a revocation.
- **Hashing** — acceptance signs a version *hash*, never an id. YAML is the
  file format; canonical JSON is the hash form. `canon::canonical_json`
  destructures `VersionRaw` with **no `..` rest pattern**, so adding a wire
  field is a compile error until someone decides whether it is hashed. A
  change to the canonical form bumps `CANONICAL_FORM`, invalidates every
  acceptance, and needs a migration note — it is never a quiet fix.
- **Gate** — `ledger verify [--gate readiness|completeness] [--json]
  [--today YYYY-MM-DD] [--no-blame]`. Fails for a schema fault plus classes
  `L001`–`L010` and **nothing else**; adding an eleventh is a format-spec
  change (`L010` itself shipped that way, as spec v1.1).
  Exit `0` conformant, `1` findings, `2` could not run. Runs in CI.
  Allocated-awaiting-acceptance is *status*, not a failure.
- **Acceptance is the principal's, never an agent's.** Do not create
  `acceptances:` entries under any framing, including fixtures — fixture
  acceptances use `fixture-human@example` and live only under
  `ledger-cli/tests/fixtures/`. Filing decisions, versions and allocations is
  fine; signing them is not. `ledger accept --group|--set` batches the
  *invocation*, never the signature: it enumerates the same selection
  `ledger show` resolves, pins it with a manifest hash, writes nothing until
  `--confirm <manifest>` presents that hash back, and then files one
  acceptance record per decision — each signing its own version hash,
  through the same per-member gate. A member whose ground is filed
  `indeterminate:` is *held* and stops the whole run by name.
- **Authoring (L1)** — every verb is a thin shell over the gate: `declare`,
  `add`, `allocate`, `escape`, `revise`, `supersede`, `accept`, `revoke`,
  `status`, `log`, `blame`. A verb builds its change-set, runs the same
  `verify` pass over the store-as-it-would-be, and refuses any write that
  introduces a finding — same class, same message, **no second validation
  copy** (the one sanctioned exception: an unallocated `add` is the
  enumerated-but-unallocated intermediate state). Identity comes from git
  config (OD-3, no `--as`); ULIDs mint via `mint::UlidMint` with injectable
  time/entropy. `revise` against a stale stated parent refuses — merge is L3.
  Hand-authoring still works: write `hash: sha256:000…0`, run `ledger
  verify`, paste the digest the `L007` finding reports.
- **Graph (L2)** — `ledger reindex` materialises `.decisions/index/ledger.ttl`
  (byte-deterministic Turtle; delete-and-rebuild is byte-identical, tested in
  CI). PROV-O provenance; `based_on` becomes open-vocabulary `ledger:basedOn`
  edges. `verify` additionally runs SPARQL shapes `G001`–`G004` (dangling
  supersession target / parent hash / undeclared decision identity / forked
  version chain) as a **distinct graph stage** outside the file gate's closed
  ten. `ledger coverage [--set … --json]` reports the seven-state disposition
  vocabulary (undecided · awaiting-acceptance · decided · escaped-priced ·
  escape-review-due · expired · superseded) per set and namespace, with
  supersession chains walked to their tips and the §8 honest limit stated.
- **Latest derives from the parent DAG, never ULID order** (spec v1.2, L3's
  first inheritance): a decision's latest version is the unique tip of its
  `parent`/`merged_from` chain — `verify::view::View` derives it, every
  consumer (`status`, `coverage`, the gate rules, the verbs) reads it. A
  chain with two tips is *forked* (`G004`): no ordering heuristic may pick a
  side, verbs refuse the decision, and only a recorded arbitration settles it.
- **Merge (L3)** — two mechanisms, never one. `ledger merge --install`
  registers a git merge driver for `.decisions/**` that settles mechanical
  cases and exits non-zero on judgment (divergent floor, edited log, ULID
  collision), conflict preserved. `ledger merge <ref>` is the read-only plan
  (per-decision classification against the merge base); `ledger merge
  --resolve` presents each conflict — both chains, common parent,
  consequences — and records the arbitration as an ordinary act: a
  reconciled version whose `merged_from` (format 2, hashed, spec v1.3)
  closes the losing tip, or a withdrawal of a losing supersession claim.
  Conflict classes: divergent-revision, divergent-allocation,
  competing-supersession (`G005`), divergent-floor, edited-log-file,
  ulid-collision. **No auto-resolution under any framing**, and acceptances
  never survive reconciliation — a reconciled version always awaits a fresh
  signature. `ledger diff <ref>..<ref>` (semantic, on
  `revision::load_at`) reports decision-level change between revisions.
- Fixture hashes refresh with
  `UPDATE_FIXTURES=1 cargo test -p ledger-cli --test gate`.

**`ledger-core` has no direct graph dependency** — no oxigraph, no SPARQL
engine of its own. Its L2 graph stage rides `product_core::pf::sparql_rules`
(OD-2); beyond that it reuses `product-core` only for `ProductError` and
`fileops`.

Agent-facing context lives in three places, all **derived from
`WHAT_POLICY`** so a new row cannot leave one describing an older table:

- `product-mcp/src/instructions.rs` — the MCP `instructions` string, built
  from `what::boundary_kinds()` / `published_kinds()` and from repo state (no
  `.ddd/` or `intercept: off` → no governance paragraph at all).
- the `product_domain_*` tool descriptions — checked by
  `product-cli/tests/agent_context.rs`.
- `.claude/skills/product-what/SKILL.md` — carries a generated block between
  `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: what-policy -->` markers. The same test fails when it
  goes stale; regenerate with:

```bash
UPDATE_SKILL=1 cargo test -p product-cli --test agent_context
```

## Evaluation store (`eval-core`, `docs/eval-format-v1.md`)

A small **format-first** crate, shared by any tool that runs a model.
[`docs/eval-format-v1.md`](docs/eval-format-v1.md) is normative; the code
follows it. Two implementations: `eval-core/` (Rust) and `eval-dotnet/` (.NET,
namespace `Eval`).

**`eval-dotnet/` is deliberately standalone** — its own solution, its own
`Directory.Build.props`, one NuGet package, and no reference to anything else
in this repo. It is meant to be lifted into another codebase as a worked
example of the pattern, so `spec-flow` is a *consumer* of it and not its owner:
`ObservedRun` names nothing spec-flow-shaped, and `SpecFlow.Cli` does the
mapping. Keep it that way — a dependency added from `Eval` back into this repo
is what would stop it being liftable. Its README is the pattern writeup
(including where `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation.Reporting` does and does
not fit).

- **Two records, separate on purpose.** `eval.run-record.v1` says what a model
  did (tool, task, subject, arrangement, `proposed`/`kept`, the reply whole,
  deterministic metrics). `eval.judgement.v1` says what another model made of
  it. **The model that executes is never the model that judges, and never
  judges at the same time** — merging them lets an opinion borrow a
  measurement's standing.
- **`proposed` vs `kept`** is the pair worth having: a human judgment on model
  output, on every run, supplied by no model and costing nothing.
- **`address` + `arrangement`** make runs comparable (format §8, from
  `docs/checking-the-worker-open-predicate.md` §4.4). The address is *where* a
  run happened — task instance plus declared ground; the arrangement is *what
  answered*. Kept apart so they vary independently: fixed address + fixed
  arrangement is run-to-run variance, fixed address + changed arrangement is
  drift in the arrangement. `behaviour::read` / `Behaviour.Read` compute both,
  plus `collapsed` (two declared-distinct addresses answered identically).
  **Neither is a verdict on any single run.** Keep the worker out of the
  address, and keep the address coarse enough to repeat — spec-flow pins
  `(task, ground)` and deliberately not the slice, since two attempts at one act
  are the same question asked twice.
- **Nothing gates.** Not signed, no principal, no gate reads either store.
- **Backends are configuration** (`EVAL_STORE`: a path, or
  `azure:<account>/<container>[/<prefix>]`). The layout is key-shaped so disk
  and object storage address identically; `Blobs`/`IBlobs` is the whole seam,
  three methods. A backend named but not built **refuses rather than falling
  back** — Azure is declared and not yet implemented.
- **`cargo t` does not cover `eval-dotnet/`** — run `dotnet test
  eval-dotnet/Eval.slnx` beside `dotnet test spec-flow/SpecFlow.slnx`.
- **The digest law is stated once** (§6) and implemented twice, held together
  by `docs/eval-format-v1/context-digest.json`, which both suites assert
  against. Regenerate with `UPDATE_FIXTURES=1 cargo test -p eval-core --test
  fixture`; a changed digest is a format change, not a test to update.
- Rides `ledger_core::canon` + `domain_hash` under its own prefix — one hashing

## Specification flow (`.spec/`, the `spec` binary + `spec-flow/`)

A fourth stack, and the first in this repo that is **not all Rust**. It
implements the specification flow's write-back leg
([format](docs/spec-flow-store-v1.md), normative) and is deliberately
split across two runtimes at the flow's own accountability boundary:

- **Rust — `spec-core` / `spec-cli` (the `spec` binary).** The act-time record
  store under `.spec/records/`, the `close` verb, and the `check` gate. This is
  the half a model may not call.
- **.NET — `spec-flow/` on the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/)
  (`Microsoft.Agents.AI` 1.21.0, net10.0).** Two verbs. `specflow import` is
  the Roslyn scanner — symbols, composition edges, entry points, candidates →
  `.spec/inventory.json`, a rebuildable projection that carries no verdict.
  `specflow implement` is a MAF workflow graph that opens a record, builds a
  slice, puts a draft to a reviewer through a typed `RequestPort`, and hands
  over a `spec close …` command it cannot run. See `spec-flow/README.md`.
- **MCP — two servers, one subset.** Both offer the delegable verbs only;
  `accept`, `reject`, `close` and `policy set` are withheld, each because it
  names a principal.
  - **`spec-mcp` (Rust binary)** — in-process over the store, no .NET needed:
    `spec_candidates`, `spec_map`, `spec_check`, `spec_records`,
    `spec_policy_show`, `spec_implement`. Rides `product-mcp`'s
    `ToolRegistry::with_tools` + stdio, same as `ddd serve`. Held by the
    registry (the tools are absent) *and* a dispatcher that refuses
    `tools::WITHHELD`. **Honest limit:** a registry boundary, not a linkage
    one — the process links `spec-core`.
  - **`specflow mcp` (.NET, MCP C# SDK 2.2.0)** — the **complete** delegable
    surface, because it adds `spec_import` (Roslyn, native). Reads are
    *proxied* to the `spec` binary through `SpecCli`, never reimplemented, so
    an MCP client and a CI run cannot be told different things. Tools carry
    MCP annotations (`ReadOnly` on the five reads, `Idempotent` on import).
    Its boundary is the strong one: the assembly contains no code that writes
    a closure, and `SpecCli.ForbiddenVerbs` throws if one is assembled.
- **The agent consumes MCP too.** `GovernedTools.ConnectAsync` connects the
  slice-building `AIAgent` to `spec-mcp` over stdio and hands it those tools
  and nothing else — so escape through un-governed tooling is structurally
  excluded, and it re-filters `Server.Withheld` rather than trusting what the
  server hands back. A missing server degrades to no tools rather than
  failing: the record, not the agent's reading, is what the write-back leg
  depends on.
- **Code may claim back.** `[Slice("id")]` and `[RealisesFact("det/…")]` are
  recognised by the Roslyn scan **by name**, so a project declares its own
  one-line attribute classes and takes no dependency on this tool. An orphan
  claim fails `S012`/`S013`: code asserting a link to a specification that does
  not exist reads as governed and is not. The attribute names are the PRD's;
  their argument shape and the reading of *fact* as *a filed determination* are
  this repo's, and the format doc says so — `prd-csharp-stack-binding.md` is
  still missing, and the PRD's C-1…C-3 / CS-1…CS-4 conditions stay unbuilt
  because they cannot be reconstructed from their names.
- **`model` is `product domain`.** The flow's event-model verb is not
  reimplemented — product-core already owns the What (§3.1/§3.2), and a second
  event-model editor is exactly the duplication this file warns about. The
  PRD's §3 rule (*`model` does not display candidates*) therefore holds as a
  **crate boundary**: `product-core` does not depend on `spec-core`, so it
  cannot read `.spec/inventory.json`, and `map` is where acts and entry points
  meet for the first time. Asserted in `spec-cli/tests/boundaries.rs` along
  with the other separations the flow rests on.
- **Rust verbs:** `candidates` · `acts` · `accept` · `reject` · `map` ·
  `implement` · `close` · `check` · `policy show|set`, plus three that only
  *launch* the .NET host — `import` → `specflow import`, `build` →
  `specflow implement`, `judge` → `specflow judge`
  (named `build` because `spec implement` is already the record-opening
  primitive the host calls back into, so the chain `spec build` → `specflow
  implement` → `spec implement` names something different at every hop).
  `spec-cli/src/verbs/host.rs` finds the host beside the binary, at
  `SPECFLOW_BIN`, or on PATH; pins it to the launching binary via `--spec`; and
  refuses to forward `accept`/`reject`/`close`/`policy`. **Launching is not
  linking** — one command name, still two executables, and the host still
  contains no code that writes a closure. The importer never names an act: candidates carry
  observed transport fields and the unfilled slots `name` / `settles`, and a
  principal fills them. `model` deliberately does not read candidates — an
  accrual vocabulary authored by walking a transport-shaped list inherits the
  defect and every act becomes an endpoint with a better name.

- **Runs are observed, never judged** (`spec-flow/src/SpecFlow.Eval/`). Every
  model-backed `spec build` writes `.spec/runs/<record-id>.json` — model,
  endpoint *host* (never the key), duration, drafted vs reviewed
  determinations, plus three deterministic `IEvaluator`s from
  `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation`: draft coherence (does the prose agree
  with the trailing array), reviewer amendment (Jaccard distance drafted→kept),
  determination shape. **Measurement, never a verdict**: beside the store not
  inside it, `Failed` hard-coded false, and `spec check` does not read it —
  asserted in `spec-cli/tests/boundaries.rs`. No judged evaluator is wired by
  default; a judge scoring the output of the thing it judges inherits its blind
  spots. Reviewer amendment is the one metric grounded in a human judgment.

- **Judging a run is itself an act** (`spec judge <record>` → `specflow judge`).
  Separate verb, separate occasion, separate arrangement
  (`SPECFLOW_JUDGE_{ENDPOINT,MODEL,KEY}` — nothing defaults to the builder's
  model). Each judgment lands at
  `.spec/judgements/<record>/<model>.<context-digest>.json` carrying **who
  judged, what they saw, and when**: the judge's `model:` identity, the
  SHA-256-pinned context (`JudgementContext.Pin`, checkable via `Holds()`), and
  the verdicts. One run keeps every opinion — two judges disagreeing over the
  same pinned context is the signal. `ratifies_nothing` is on the record, there
  is no principal field, and the gate reads neither `.spec/runs/` nor
  `.spec/judgements/`. The judge is shown what the act settles via `spec acts
  --id` (a read, proxied, never re-parsed in .NET) — without it two models each
  correctly answered that nothing could be warranted.

**The boundary is the design, not packaging.** The agent host does not link the
code that writes a closure, so there is no call it could make — the PRD's
"structural, not instructed" requirement, held by a process boundary rather
than by a rule someone remembers. Three independent guards:
`SpecCli.ForbiddenVerbs` (throws on an assembled `close`), a reflection test
over the exported surface, and a graph with no edge to a closure.

- **A slice can be built unattended; it cannot be closed unattended.**
  `spec implement` always exits **3** — *work completed, closure pending*.
  Distinct from `1` on purpose: it lets an agent harness say "I finished my
  half" without it reading as "I broke something". `spec check` fails on an
  open record, so a branch carrying a built slice and no closure does not merge.
- **Closing declares something; silence is neither.** `--nothing-arose` is a
  positive declaration with its own discriminant, the same shape as
  `asserted-none`. A `close` with neither `--determination` nor
  `--nothing-arose` is refused, never defaulted.
- **Verdict classes are closed at fifteen** — `S001` unclosed record, `S002`
  machine principal (on a closure, a ratification *or* a refusal), `S003`
  closure not binding its opening, `S004` kind disagreeing with its payload,
  `S005` entry point no act covers, `S006` record naming an unratified act,
  `S007` ratification/refusal not binding its content, `S008`–`S011` the
  policy's own well-formedness (B-1/B-2/B-3 plus the uncovered set), `S012`
  orphan `[Slice]`, `S013` orphan `[RealisesFact]`, `S014` unsigned in a
  signing repo, `S015` a signature that does not verify. All structural, none
  project-configurable; adding a sixteenth is a change to the format doc, not
  a patch. `S002` delegates to
  `ledger_core::identity::Identity::model_or_bot_reason` — the same test
  `L006` applies to an acceptor. **One identity law, two gates.**
- **`map` reports, `check` gates.** merge / split / unmapped-entry-point /
  unmapped-act are a restructuring work list, not verdicts, and the metrics
  beneath the verdicts (coverage included) are reported and never gated.
  A refused candidate *covers* its entry point: `S005` fails on silence, not
  on the absence of an act.
- **Hashing rides the ledger's canonical law** (`ledger_core::canon` +
  `domain_hash`) under two prefixes, `spec.act-record.v1` and
  `spec.act-closure.v1`. Each digest builder destructures its subject with **no
  `..` rest pattern**, so a new wire field is a compile error until someone
  decides whether it is hashed.
- **One writer.** Every verb builds the record it would write, judges it with
  `check`, and refuses on a finding — same class, same message, no second
  validation copy. `store::close` returns `Closed::Refused(findings)` rather
  than an error, so the caller exits `1` for a finding and `2` only when it
  genuinely could not run.
- **Two classes of verdict, only one configurable.** Structural verdicts
  (`S001`–`S011`) are not project business. **Policy verdicts** are: filed as
  append-only versions under `.spec/policy/<ulid>.yml`, each with
  `fires_when`, `basis` and `principal`, and the version in force is the tip
  of the `supersedes` chain — never id order, and a forked chain is a finding.
  `basis_binds` is the hash of the `fires_when` it was written against and is
  **not** auto-filled: moving a threshold without revisiting the argument
  fails `S009`, and the gate reports the digest to paste the way `ledger
  verify` does. **The default is structural only** — no shipped thresholds,
  because that would presume a basis nobody stated.
- **Signing (§4e), opt-in at the repo.** ed25519 via `spec trust generate`;
  off until `.spec/trust/` carries a key, and turning it off means deleting
  keys — a reviewable edit, not a per-record flag. Signatures cover the
  **recomputed** digest, so tampering breaks `S015` directly rather than
  leaning on `S003`; and because every digest already covers its principal, a
  signature cannot be lifted onto another principal's record. Secret keys are
  refused a path inside the repo. **Adopting later does not invalidate the
  past**: an act nobody could have signed is graced for *absence* only — a
  signature that is present is always verified. Honest limit: this says a key
  holder acted, not that the human did; custody, rotation and revocation are
  not modelled, and the ledger's own `Acceptance.signature` is still empty at
  L0, so the two stores are not yet on the same footing.

Build and test both halves:

```bash
cargo build -p spec-cli                 # the Rust half, required by the .NET tests
dotnet test spec-flow/SpecFlow.slnx     # drives the real binary in a temp repo
```

The .NET tests locate the binary at `target/debug/spec`, or via `SPEC_BIN`.

## Phase-gated session (What → How → Build)

`product session start <product>` (or `product mcp --workflow --session <id>`)
launches a **phase-gated** authoring session: the agent CLI (`[author].cli` —
claude or copilot) drives the graph *only through MCP tools*, writing the
**canonical `.product` graph directly** (no workspace copy — the session record
is just `workflow.json` under `.product/sessions/<id>/`). The transport
(`product-mcp/src/workflow.rs`) gates the tool surface by phase — `tools/list`
shows only the current phase's family, and out-of-phase calls are rejected:

- **What** — `product_domain_*`, `product_decider_*`, `product_projector_*`,
  `product_primitive_*`, `product_scope_*` (§14 authoring scopes — the intake
  concept: `add`/`list`/`show`/`validate`/`enforce`/`join`).
- **How** — `product_how_*`, `product_blueprint_*` (alias `product_archetype_*`),
  `product_deployable_unit_*`, `product_cell_*`,
  `product_work_unit_*` (the atomic slice), `product_worker_*`.
- **Build** — `product_feature_*`, `product_deliverable_*`, `product_release_*`,
  `product_target_*`, `product_build_run`.

Read-only tools from an earlier phase stay callable; writes lock to their home
phase (`phase_of` in `workflow.rs` is the single source of truth). Three control
tools are visible in every phase: `product_workflow_status`,
`product_workflow_advance`, and `product_session_finalize` — which validates the
What and, if conformant, stamps provenance and closes the session. Writes land
in canonical as they happen (`RepoLock` serializes them); there is no draft
rollback — an abandoned session's edits stay in the graph.

## Key Conventions

- **No unwrap**: `#![deny(clippy::unwrap_used)]` — use `?`, `.ok_or()`, `.unwrap_or_default()`, or match
- **Error model**: All errors go through `ProductError` in `error.rs` — each variant maps to a specific exit code
- **Atomic writes**: File writes use `fileops::atomic_write()` with advisory locking. MCP write-tool handlers hold a `RepoLock`; a validation failure rolls back the whole node (no partial writes — supply every shape-required field in one call)
- **Graph is derived**: No persistent graph store. The What graph is held in a session and serialized to Turtle/YAML under `.product/`
- **Pure `pf/`**: every file in `product-core/src/pf/` depends only on `crate::error` — the framework graph is self-contained

### CLI ↔ MCP parity

Every `product_*` MCP tool mirrors a `product` subcommand and must accept the
same fields. Two gotchas the current code encodes — preserve them:

- **The `kind` overload.** `product_domain_new` uses the top-level `kind` arg to
  *route the node type* and drops it from the field map, but `System` (§3.2.5) and
  `ContextMapping` (§3.1) each carry a real `kind` *struct field*. The router
  shadows the field, so those sub-kinds arrive via the aliases `system_kind` /
  `mapping_kind` (mirroring the CLI's `--system-kind` / `--mapping-kind`),
  normalized back to `kind` in `domain_handlers::normalize_kind_aliases`. Any new
  field whose name collides with a routing key needs the same alias treatment.
- **Singletons via `product_how_set`.** `target` is one of
  `app-contract | infra-contract | version | realises-version`; for the two §7.3
  versions the `id` arg carries the version string (CLI `--id`).

## Architecture Pattern — Slice + Adapter

The codebase is organised as vertical slices (module organization — *not* the
§7.1 delivery feature), each with a pure domain module in `product-core` and a
thin CLI adapter in `product-cli/src/commands/`. This separation keeps business
logic unit-testable without tempdirs, print capture, or `cargo run`, and lets
sibling CLIs (`decision-cli`) reuse the slice library without inheriting the CLI
surface (FT-107).

**Slice modules (`product-core/src/<mod>/`)** — pure, testable:
- `plan_*` / `build_*` functions take current state + user input, return a
  struct describing the intended change. No I/O, no println, no exit.
- `apply_*` functions take a plan struct and perform the minimal I/O
  (`fileops::write_file_atomic`, `write_batch_atomic`) needed to commit it.
- `render_*` functions turn result structs into text strings. JSON rendering
  is derived from `serde::Serialize` on the plan / result types.
- Unit tests (`src/<mod>/tests.rs`) exercise the pure functions directly.

Reference modules (`product-core/src/pf/`) — the vertical slices are the
framework kinds:
- e.g. `pf/decider*` (derive/validate/simulate the §3.3 Decider),
  `pf/projector*` (§3.4), `pf/feature*` (§7.1 delivery feature), `pf/how*`,
  `pf/seam*`, and the `domain` CRUD pipeline (`pf/edit.rs` → `pf/validate.rs` →
  `pf/turtle.rs`/`pf/seed.rs`).

**Command adapters (`product-cli/src/commands/<cmd>.rs`)** — thin:
- A read/write adapter returns `CmdResult = Result<Output, ProductError>`; it
  loads the What graph via a pf session loader, calls the slice's pure
  `derive_*`/`validate_*`/`plan_*`+`apply_*`, and wraps the result in `Output`.
  Never call `println!`.
- Wire into `dispatch()` in `commands/dispatch.rs` (PF families funnel through
  `dispatch_pf`).

**Handlers that remain on `BoxResult`** are intentional — keep them where a
handler prints continuous progress (`build`, `author`, `init`, `mcp`), has
exit-code semantics `CmdResult` can't express, or is a trivial wrapper
(`completions`, `hooks`).

## Adding a New Command

1. Add the clap subcommand in `src/commands/<cmd>.rs` and the variant in
   `commands/root_enum.rs` (keep the variant list sorted — the
   `cli_subcommands_are_sorted` fitness gate enforces it); declare the module in
   `commands/mod.rs`.
2. If the command has non-trivial logic, create a slice at `product-core/src/pf/<cmd>*`.
3. Implement the handler as a thin adapter.
4. Wire into `commands/dispatch.rs`.
5. Add unit tests on the pure slice functions (a `pf/<cmd>_tests.rs` sibling).
6. Add a framework integration test in `product-cli/tests/framework.rs` with `assert_cmd`.
7. If the command mutates the graph, add the mirror `product_<cmd>_*` MCP tool
   (schema in `product-mcp/src/tools/`, handler in `product-mcp/src/`, dispatch in
   `registry.rs`) and place it in the right session phase via `workflow::phase_of`.

## Adding a New Node Kind (pf graph)

A node kind lives in **five hand-maintained parallel enumerations** — miss one
and the kind silently vanishes on a Turtle round-trip (which `finalize` and the
`from_spec` reload depend on), with no error. When adding a kind to
`DomainGraph`, wire **all** of:

1. the struct field on `DomainGraph` (`pf/model*.rs`) and its `counts()` row;
2. Turtle **emit** (`pf/turtle*.rs`);
3. seed **parse** (`pf/seed*.rs`) — emit and parse must be symmetric;
4. `seed_canon::canonicalize` — sort the new list (and any id-list fields), or
   re-export churns and the byte-stability test fails;
5. `pf/viz.rs` if the kind should render in the web view.

The guard: `pf/seed_tests.rs::maximal()` builds one node of **every** kind and
`full_graph_round_trips_losslessly` proves emit→parse→canon is lossless, while
`maximal_populates_every_node_kind` fails by name if a kind is added to
`counts()` but not to `maximal()` — so steps 1–4 cannot be silently skipped.

Delivery artifacts (features, deliverables, releases, targets, work units) are
**not** graph node kinds — they are standalone YAML under `.product/`, so they do
not touch these five enumerations.

## Test Organization

- **Unit tests**: `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` (or a `#[path] mod tests` sibling) at the bottom of each `pf/` source file — the real framework-graph coverage.
- **Framework integration tests**: `product-cli/tests/framework.rs` using `assert_cmd` + a temp-dir `Harness` (`init --demo` → `domain`/`decider`/…).
- **Fitness gates**: `product-cli/tests/code_quality_tests.rs` (file length ≤ 400, function length, SRP, module structure, sorted subcommands).
- **Property tests**: `product-core/tests/property/` using `proptest` (fileops/init).

## Documentation System

- **Framework spec** (source of truth): `docs/product-framework-open.md` — the open standard for What/How/Delivery, §-numbered. It mirrors the canonical `../product-framework`; on re-sync, patch the `preview/{build-seam,codegen,conformance}/` links back to `schema/json/...` (the framework repo keeps them under `preview/`, product-cli vendors them under `schema/json/`). `schema/json/build-seam/` (§5.1) has siblings `schema/json/codegen/` (the code-generation seam §5.2) and `schema/json/conformance/` (the §6.3.1 wire protocol).
- **Conformance clauses**: `docs/two-pillars-conformance.md`.
- **Examples + workshop**: `docs/examples/`, `docs/workshop/`, `docs/workshop-runbook.md`.

## Dependencies

Key crates: clap (CLI), serde/serde_yaml/serde_json/toml (serialization), oxigraph (RDF/SPARQL — the `pf` rule engine + seed parser), axum/tokio (HTTP server), sha2 (hashing), fd-lock (file locking), chrono (dates).

Dev: tempfile, assert_cmd, predicates, proptest.
